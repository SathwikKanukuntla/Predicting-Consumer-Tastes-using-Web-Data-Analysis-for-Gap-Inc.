      "Please be careful with the final sale of clothing sets that are sold separately! I purchased both the suit jacket and pants in a very specific color (sold separately but intended as a set, due to color match) but was informed 5 days later that the jacket was not in inventory. Since both items were final sale I am now stuck with suit pants that I cannot use as they are not understanding the intention of purchasing these items together. I've been informed there is nothing they are able/willing to do which leaves me stuck and very frustrated with their product and services. I hoped they would have been more understanding to keep their customers satisfied but I suppose it is more important to stick to a company policy than keep future customers. \n",
      "Estimated shipping date at time of purchase several days earlier than actual eta when shipping confirmation was ultimately sent. As it turned out I'd be out of the country for the real delivery date. I contacted customer service to either expedite or hold the shipment, they would do nothing for and had no interest whatsoever in helping. Too many options out there to waste my time and money with them again.\n",
      "I purchased 1 shirt online, husband tried on, didn't fit, fabric also thin and not great looking. Returned it immediately thru online system, as no store nearby. It took about a week to get to returns dept. Now still WAITING for REFUND. They did deduct from balance shipping to return item. However, used Chat as recommended and was told return processing can take 10-15, THEN a team has to inspect items which can take another 10 days....!!! So it might take 25 days PLUS shipping time of a week to get a partial refund! WOW horrible customer service. Amazon returns actually give back the funds AS SOON as the PREPAID Label is scanned in the system when picked up! Fabulous...I would NOT RECOMMEND this company unless you are 100% sure things will fit and you like them, otherwise it takes about 30 days for your money back! WHY would someone shop here? NOT ME EVER AGAIN!\n",
      "I am unable to shop online at bananarepublic.com since they changed the layout of their website. It makes me dizzy and nauseous and I'm unable to spend more than a few seconds on the site. It's sad because I was a loyal customer for many years. I have seen other comments about their skyrocketing prices...I wouldn't know because the website leaves me physically ill.\n",
      "Today I ended my relationship with this retailer. I was loyal customer for over 20years. NO MORE! As their prices exponentially increased and tripled their customer service across the board and specially in the break and mortar stores decreased! Employees rude and not very helpful. No one want to deliver a customer service anymore! However, the worst part is that as consumers we are not protected against that type of retailers who making up rules as they going alone!\n",
      "Purchased a suit (matching jacket and pants) on sale. After some weird emails about how the shipped jacket (shipped separately for some reason) is out of stock. The problem is that they won’t take the pants back. The deal was the suit. Who buys just suit pants? When I explained that I don’t want half a suit they just said check back in a few days. It may come back in stock. Just refund the order BR. C'mon. So I’ll just never shop them anymore. Don’t wanna deal with their robot/off shore customer service. If they couldn’t care less, I won’t either. I hope they get a class action lawsuit for their coding practices that allow them to get rid of inventory that no one will want. BR projects this above average status, yet the practices are shady and basically wrong doing.\n",
      "I'm so done with this store. Their customer service is the worst I've ever encountered in my over 70 years on this planet. They should just start over or close down. I've literally spent hours on the phone over a minor issue. Their supervisors are just as clueless. Each one reads, not well, from a script that often doesn't even address the issue at hand. What a shame. They used to be great.\n",
      "I was a loyal customer for many years. Not any longer. I’m disappointed in their major price increase, the looks and ease of their website, and the fact you can’t return sale items. The website is dark and gloomy and you can’t tell what it is the picture of the model is advertising because they take long shots and show the entire outfit and they’re standing in a position that you can’t actually see how the pants or shirt or sweater fit OR a coat is covering what is advertised! They have increased prices DRASTICALLY. Not just a little, but most items are double or triple what you would have paid before they revamped. It’s absolutely atrocious that they don’t allow returns on sale items. I don’t know of a single store that does this. I don’t see them being around a lot longer because they have zero concerns for the consumer.\n",
      "I bought a Jacket in 2 different sizes, I received both jackets, the Small fit better and when I tried returning the Medium I was told it's final sale, so now I'm stuck with 2 of the same jackets. Final sale for online items should be illegal, because how do you know if the item will fit properly? This just means Banana Republic does not back their back their product, because when you trust that you are selling a good product, you don't need to make such ridiculous return policies. I'm truly disappointed, after over 10 years of shopping at Banana Republic and thousands of $ spent on this company, I can't believe they are doing this to their customers...\n",
      "While I was out of the country, they switched banks, and then doing so it locked me out of my account. I was not able to resume access without physical possession of a card that I was unable to reach until I returned home. During this time $30 went past due, and they assessed late fees and charges, despite knowing that I, and I’m sure MANY others, were locked out of our accounts by their doing. Out of our control. I called customer service, and they said they couldn’t locate my account… Transferred me to another department, which could. They collected my full payment through an automated system, before transferring me to a very rude customer service rep, who kept interrupting me and challenging my statements. They made it incredibly difficult to reactivate my account. I had been an active customer for 20 years. Today they lost me. Barclay’s sucks. And Banana Republic Corporate sucks. Retail workers are great. But after 20 years - I’m out.\n",
      "I'm 6'5\" and look for nice T-shirts that are tall and extra large. BR t-shirts seemed to fit the bill. However, their Luxe Touch Performance t-shirts shrank after one wash and the collars are wrinkled. I do not recommend buying these shirts. I do like their Premium Wash shirts as they seem to hold up fine after washing. \n",
      "I ordered three items to be expedited overnight for a very important business trip. I paid a very high fee for expedited shipping. The company kept showing the same date for three days for when the items will be delivered. The package was lost by Banana Republic, and they never updated shipping date. UPS never received it. I never had time to buy new clothing, and they offered no explanation and no apology. Extremely disappointed. \n",
      "Placed an order and realized it was not the fit I wanted. I tried to cancel and they refuse to cancel my order after 1 hour of placing. Definitely won't buy from them again. Spoke to Shannon ** and rudely laughed and when I asked to speak to someone else she hung up. \n",
      "Purchased a brand new utility jacket that was to be mailed out to me. I was not given a receipt nor was I informed of a new exchange policy that occurred days before. When I had to exchange it, I was not allowed to because of a few days difference despite that they had record of my purchase. Apparently the package it arrived in was the receipt. Called customer service and even contacted BBB. They simply did not care. Jacket is brand new with tags, unworn, it didn’t fit. Having been a loyal customer of 20 years I was greatly disappointed. I froze my credit cards and will definitely take my business elsewhere, it’s apparent they just don’t care. \n",
      "I placed an order for items. Received notice 3 had shipped and one scheduled for later shipment. First, I received notice my order had been delivered. I was at home, and it was not delivered. I called BR customer service. The person with whom I spoke could not understand me nor I her. I told her my package had not been received. She kept saying, \"So, you received your package?\" After a few times of this, she put me on hold and told me to wait until tomorrow and call back if not received. I asked what time should I call. She responded, \"Yes, call tomorrow.\" I gave up after each of us had said the same thing 4 times. In checking on all this I noticed the delayed item had been canceled. When I asked why I had not been notified of it not being available. She responded, \"Yes, the item is not available.\" Once again, I gave up after we each repeated this interchange 4 times.\n",
      "Banana Republic is now using Lasership to ship packages and the experience is beyond frustrating. My expectation is not of next day or even 2 day delivery, but Lasership has the most random updates on their tracking and in general, packages will have no status updates for days. You can do better than this.\n",
      "Recently I have noticed that unless you call multiple times you will not be issued a refund for your return. They got my return delivered 4 weeks ago. Multiple calls to very polite customer service and still no refund. They are \"transferred the issue\" to another department. I have their credit card and have been a good client with Luxe status for over a decade. And is the second time this year. Don't waste your time ordering from them. Shop in stores. Feel very disappointed. Shame on them.\n",
      "I ordered a shirt that was too large and returned it via mail. The tracking page told me it could take about 10 days for the refund to be issued. After 10 days I contacted an agent and they told me it could take up to 15 days. After 15 days I contacted customer service again and a different agent said it would take 20 days, \"per their return policy\". This policy is nowhere on their website, and when I asked why it would take so long, the agent kept copy/pasting \"please be advised, per our return policy, your refund could take 15-20 days\" and refused to answer my questions. Horrible customer service, and I now need to get my credit card company involved since they keep adding bogus days to the time it takes to issue a refund.\n",
      "Let me start off by writing that Banana Republic & Gap have the worst customer service and I have FACED IT RECENTLY. They have no idea how to resolve the issues and twice in two weeks customer service has promised that MANAGER will back within 24-48hrs and no one has called. Why would someone give a timeline and not call, IT IS SO RUDE. When you ask to speak to Manager they say one is not available now and will schedule a call back. All customer service does is, \"Let me put you on list so they can call you back.\" They do not honor what they say and just brush it off by saying misinformation was provided.\n",
      "I traveled to Washington DC. I shopped at Banana Republic. The store was crowded and I didn't have much time. I didn't try on the items and a few things did not fit. I called to find out an address I could return the items. The policy is you have to return to the store. That's fine, but Banana Republic does not have any stores within 4 hours of me. If I hold them until I travel again they won't take them. This is policy makes no sense. Stores are closing all the time. I will not purchase their clothing on vacation anymore. I also signed up for their rental program Style Passport. It is the worst. Once you get on it the clothes look nothing like the website. I don't know where they get the cloths for this thing but the style and quality are really bad. Total waste of money! I won't be shopping here or their other companies anymore.\n",
      "On November 8th, 2020 I placed an order for this cape. It stated online it would ship around the 27th of the month. Also, it was on sale when the order was placed. November 27th came and went. On December 24th received an email stating my order was cancelled. I go on the website January 2, 2021 to find the cape was being offered at full price and already sold out. I confused because how could orders not be fulfilled on an item that is being offered in a previous month. So disappointed because I purchase a lot of my pieces from here. The customer service has really went down.\n",
      "Very, very bad experience. Never in my life will buy from Banana again. They should learn from Amazon service. I returned the package for refund. Called, was told twice that money was refunded to my credit card. Also received an email that money will be refunded within 10 days. A month later, no money refunded. Spend more than an hour with them and the bank, but still dont have the refund. Good by Banana.\n",
      "I have been a die hard fan of BR but the brand has gone completely downhill. The styles for the most part are drab and no longer geared to the professional woman. The fabric is cheap and the fit is horrible. The Sloan pants that were my go to pants have changed and the size is way off and no longer fits my body, no matter what size. If you do find something that is work appropriate it’s close to $100 for a blouse made of poor quality. I am so disappointed and I will no longer be shopping at any BR store.\n",
      "What an ABSOLUTE waste of my time and energy. A company like this should have out of stock items for online shopping updated as it happens instead of taking my order and keeping me waiting more than 24hrs just to tell me they don't have both items I ordered. They offered 10% off future purchases, but it is absolutely unlikely I will EVER shop with this company online again. Who’s to say the same thing won’t happen time after time? I just wasted 24hrs when I could have been shopping elsewhere. PATHETIC - this is part of their message: \"We're sorry, but while processing your order, we found that the item(s) below are no longer available. We value your business and apologize for any inconvenience.\"\n",
      "I had a few rewards from previous purchases and a merchandise credit voucher. I was told by a store employee that the rewards are expired, but I can call the company and they will reissue them. He closed my account and reopened a new one so I could buy my items chosen that day. Fast forward...when I called Banana Republic I was told I have lost the rewards and they don’t recognize the merchandise credit (total $130-150). I am disappointed because the company could have made a decision to reissue the rewards and the credit, but chose to do nothing. I just closed my new BR account due to not honoring their rewards and credits within own company. Be aware if you are not using your rewards in a timely matter they will be lost and not reissued as said by employees. They need to get on the same page in regards to passing info to customers.\n",
