Unfornately at under the $200 mark I couldn't really find many jackets that fit the bill for me, alpha slim fit n3b's are too shiny (noted many times in this subreddit), most of the asos offerings don't look timeless and returns would be a hassle.

With Old Navy the fit between pairs of jeans within the same family/style/cut varies a fair bit so I can find pairs that fit me *juuuust* right, but Levis have consistently been too tight in the thighs or too baggy in the waist/butt. Haven't tried Nudies, although my little brother loves 'em, I doubt I could/would shoehorn myself into a set.\n",

      "These pants are the most comfortable pair of pants I own.  Moreso than any of my joggers or my BR Traveler jeans.  ABC means anti-ball-crushing, which just means they have a significant amount of stretch and are quite fitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I comfortably wear a size 34 waist in Banana Republic Traveler/GAP jeans and I had to size a full size up to a 36 which is snug.  The inseam on the talls is every bit of 37\" and 34\" on the regulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall design of the pants is fantastic.  It's not an over-the-top technical pant but it has some nice-to-have features.  There's a back zipper pocket inside the regular pocket which I stash my passport in when I travel. There's also a pocket within the front left pocket which is the exact size of an iPhone plus.  If you cuff your pants there's a little reflective strip which I guess lets drivers know they're about to hit something at night and a tiny little lululemon logo halfway up the leg that lets them know you can afford to sue during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The matte finish on these pants does not look like it's a stretch material until you get very close.  Boy, do I appreciate the material.  It's so flexible and breathable.  I've been much more cool and comfortable in these in 100 degree heat than a pair of khaki shorts.  The downside: the light khaki gets dirty easily.  On the other hand, you can wash something off of them with water while wearing them and they'll be dry 10 minutes later.\n",

      "\n",
      "Upon receiving these pants, they are so very obviously Old Navy's version of the ABC pant, complete with reflective cuff strip. That's not a bad thing though: they seemingly cut corners in all the right places.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered these pants in both a 34x36 and a 36x36.  The 36x36 is snug enough in the waist.  Typically in my experience for Old Navy pants the waist and inseam are both a little bit smaller than a GAP/BR pant in the same size, which is why I ordered the size up as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall fit of these is a little more traditional than the ABC with what feels like more rise and a little more material on the back end.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fit and finish of these pants is a more what you expect of Old Navy.  The seams are more obvious.  They used a plastic button instead of a metal one.  The insides of the pockets are just plain mesh and there are no fancy pockets.  The fabric is very close to the ABC pant but just different enough that it looks a little stretchy when you're not as close.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered these pants with 40% off plus another 30% from signing up for emails, bringing them to under $19.  That's a steal for what i got in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend either of these pants to anyone.  If you're a buy-a-lot-of-clothes-and-hardly-wear-them type of person, I'd go with the Old Navy's for hot summer days when you need pants.  If you're the kind of person who travels a lot and needs a single pair of pants to last you every occasion for a week in the summer, spring for the ABC pants.\n",

I just received my order today and realized 2 of the items I purchased don't fit me too well. If i return these items in store will I somehow be deducted a fee because my order is no longer above $50?\n",
      "I ask because A) they're currently $6 apiece on Old Navy's website, and B) I love the fit on the Mossimos but the color selection at my local Target is mediocre at best, and the Old Navy ones seem much better.  Pictures would be much appreciated, if possible.\n",

Ironically, the two brands that fit best so far are Old Navy and Uniqlo. I have more money to work with in my budget and I'm looking for 'premium' brands that have a similar fit. Mainly shirts which are 38-40 in the chest but around a 30-31 in the waist. Old Navy smalls fit me great. I'm looking at Uniqlo's site right now too and it looks like their medium should fit me. Banana Republic mediums, on the other hand, are too long and wide in the waist, and their smalls are too tight in the chest. J-Crew has similar sizing.

      "We took a medium, large, x-large, and xx-large tall t-shirts from Old Navy, put them through the wash once on cold and let them air dry. We tore out the seams so we could obtain the actual measurements they used to cut the cloth. With the sample Reddit provided, body size boards were constructed based on averages of each of the categories that our algorithm generated. The boards are correct in shoulder, chest, and torso.\n",

      "**Shrinkage**\n",
      "There wasn’t much shrinkage along the torso. The chest for L-XXL lost 0.25 inches, .5 inches, and 1 inch respectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Adjustments**\n",
      "For the sizing boards, we made certain adjustments to take into account that clothing is never made based on skin tight measurements. For example, we expanded the chest by 2 inches because you need some breathing room and an inflated chest from a deep breath can make that difference.\n",

      "**Overview**\n",
      "Old Navy’s tall t-shirts were all very wide. The construction, especially around the sleeves wasn’t particularly well done. The bottom of the sleeves where the seam is was extremely short. This leads to some weird folding in the shirt when you lift your arms.\n",

      "http://i.imgur.com/Z6tRCqE.jpg\n",
      "\n",
      "The fabric was also thinner than some higher quality t-shirts would be. It’s one thing to be rocking nipple points, but another thing to have your nipples visible through the shirt. These t-shirts are likely to show holes much sooner than t-shirts with a higher GSM. However, at $7-10 a shirt, they’re cheap. Replacing them every year would not be an unfeasible option.\n",

      "\n",
      "The Old Navy medium is obviously too long for Reddit Size 1 and is likely to be a little tight in the chest. Medium may be a passable fit for Reddit Size 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Navy large is probably *too* large for both Reddit Size 1 & 2. It’s way too long for Reddit Size 1 and it will be pretty wide for Reddit Size 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Navy x-large is somewhat long for Reddit Size 3. This bucket of sizing contained a large variance in torso lengths. So if the x-large fits the chest & shoulders, you can consider trying this to see if the torso length is too much or just right. This is likely to be a little small for Reddit Size 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Navy xx-large was massive like a tent. A family of chipmunks could live in this t-shirt with a Reddit Size 4. Unless you have the girth, your shirt is going to flap around even if you have the torso length. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I explained in our previous post. The Gods of Greece bucket is for people who are both really tall and really swole. It also contained way too few data samples for us to make a meaningful sizing. We will update if we ever feel like we can draw some decent sizes out of the data. Rest assured, you are not forgotten.\n",

I think the hobbyists here fit far more into the person who buys a [GR Yaris](https://toyotagazooracing.com/gr/yaris/).

KJ’s post was a bit of an inflection point for this: someone who clearly treats clothes as a hobby, rather than a means to an end, which appeared to strike a chord with a number of users that found it apparently incomprehensible that someone with a clothing hobby would be consistently buying clothing.\n",

Now, the problem is, many shops (ie: ASOS, Karmaloop, etc.) offer good deals, but by the time you add on international shipping, plus duties and taxes the deals aren't really worth it any more. So, with this guide, I think it'd be a good idea to limit it to either brick and mortar stores that are common in Canada or online stores that ship out from Canada, thus eliminating duties and whatnot.

I am still in the process of filling my closet, as I graduated within the last 3 years, but as of now it contains brands such as Todd Snyder, A Kind of Guise, Howlin, Gitman Bros, Brain Dead, Alden and Yuketen for shoes etc. and where applicable, I will make comparisons to these brands as I see fit. I will also say I believe the aim of Aime is one hype piece per drop, rather than filling your closet, like I’ve done here. Is this a recommendation to buy any of these clothes?

      "\n",
      "My first Aime piece, a birthday gift to myself at the end of 2020. I am a huge Clarks fan, as I love the history (grew up around Jamaican immigrants when I was a kid in NY) and the versatility in my work and street fits. I have owned 2 wallabees before this: a Todd Snyder collaboration and a normal pair, and these are my favorite clarks by far. These are significantly more comfortable than both Clarks (especially the TS ones) and have a higher level of formality because of the casentino wool that I really appreciate. They really shine with gray sweatpants, but look at home with sweaters and chinos in the office. That being said, I do think the color of the maple suede clarks are a bit more versatile than these tan ones, so I reach for them far less often than I’d like. The casentino wool, while nice, is also a bit much to clean and because of this you can’t really wear them in the winter, which is when you’d like to wear wool shoes. \n",

This cardigan is a really thick and soft 100% wool knit; I can often wear it over a cotton T-shirt in 30 degree weather and feel warm without irritation. Aside from the functionality, I love the colorful tree pattern and have yet to see anything even remotely similar. I frequently wear this in the office and in day to day activities. It is one of my most complimented pieces as well, and a year later I’m still smiling when I put it on. \n",

I also love the colors; I own the paprika and the parmesan, and I really like how modern the knit looks and how deeply colored the yarns are. These are sweaters I bust out more often than my Howlin sweaters, and they were around the same price point. Only downside is that pilling has started to develop under the arms, but based on the softness of the wool I’m not surprised so this is no big deal. \n",

      "I love Drake’s. Perhaps to an unhealthy amount for a normal person. So when I found the last ALD Ochre chore coat on Drake's website, I had to cop. This jacket is everything I’ve ever wanted and more. Perfectly cut so it doesn’t look oversized when placed over a T-shirt, but can fit a hoodie underneath. Longer than an average chore, so you can play with proportions with low rise or high rise trousers. Love the versatility; I wear it over an OCBD for interviews (it’s my lucky coat) and over t-shirts for something more casual. I love the details, the corduroy trim on the collar and sleeves, the five pockets, and the ALD/Drakes patch on the pocket. This is truly my favorite piece in my closet and one of my favorite garments I’ve ever handled. \n",

      "Was really riding high on the ALD train when I bought this one. Would have also loved to be able to get the pants but alas it sold out.

That being said, it is my most worn jacket by far, it’s great for blocking wind, pretty warm, and  waterproof, in combination with a sweater from above I can wear at 10 degrees F and still be comfortable. It does “shed” some fibers from time to time, so I’m interested in how this piece will age in time. Not to mention, I really think any quilted jacket can achieve what this jacket does for my closet. However, I do like the general size as it’s a great midlayer, I love the buttoned vents at the back to increase airflow, I love that you can roll up the sleeves, and I like the collar. I will also add this in the jackets favor; I recently bought the Todd Snyder quilted jacket and pants, and I returned them immediately. The Woolrich jacket is significantly warmer and more durable, while the TS version is “softer” which makes me afraid of tearing. Was it worth the entire price difference? Not at all, but there is a quality difference worthy of mention. \n",

I personally hate fleece, don’t love the material on my skin and really feel anxious about putting it in the wash. So a 100% wool pullover was right up my alley. This is what ALD/Drakes does really well imo, and it slaps as a garment. Love the quality of the pullover, not soft by any means, but not uncomfortable and incredibly hearty. I reach for it so often, especially in my wardrobe as a lot of it tends to skew more formal. Coffee with the SO? Movies with friends? Going to my local bookstore? Toss on the fleece, jeans and some Indy boots. Running to the grocery store? Fleece, sweats and sneakers. I also love wearing it on top of a button up or even another sweater for office wear. I can also fit a hoodie underneath which makes it great for more layered fits on colder days. Love the embroidery, and I love the structure of the collar.

I love a good white t-shirt in the summer months but this shirt is a thick one, so great for layering but I think it will be regulated to my spring and fall wardrobes.

      "The most expensive item in my closet, but fuck it I love this tuxedo jacket. I love the unstructured silhouette, the 6x2 double breasted buttons, the large lapels that add a really grand air when the jacket is open, but significantly more subdued when the jacket is closed. Love the midnight blue color. It really does look black in iridescent yellow lighting and the blue adds a certain level of panache when seen in the correct lighting. The patch pockets do make this jacket less formal, so I would not recommend wearing this in a setting in which the black tie details matter. However the patch pockets aren’t super noticeable unless someone is looking for it, and I think it does add some personality to the jacket. That being said, this is a fun jacket and  the pants are also well made. However the rise is quite high, not a complaint just something to note. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Worth it:** Absolutely not, on paper, would I recommend this Tuxedo set, but for me this is more of a collectors item than a wearable piece. I have longed to buy a formal suit set from Drake’s for a while, so decided to simply cop this one. \n",

      "So did a lot of research on this one and while I copped it, I would not recommend anyone else do the same. The colors are great, the best part of this jacket by far. After the woolrich drop this year, I looked high and low for something similar and couldn’t find something I liked that hit the same tone (aside from the Arc’teryx rush or the arc x beams collab). The jacket is only a 2L so it’s not going to last as long as a 3L jacket, nor be as waterproof,  and in terms of pure utility, you can definitely find a better jacket for a cheaper price. Now to be honest I’m not much of an outdoorsman, so I took the color over the functionality, but for my purposes it works. I have worn this jacket pretty much every day since I bought it two weeks ago and it holds up well in rain conditions. I walked for about 2 hours with it on and while my bottom half was soaking wet, my top half was completely dry. It is not a warm jacket, as it is only a shell, but it does a decent job of blocking the wind (even the hood) and I appreciate the armpit zips for increased breathability. I also like the microfiber detailing in the pocket and the neckline. The stashable hood also makes it very versatile. The hood itself works, but sadly is only 1 point adjustable, so it’s not the best fit for your head, but certainly not terrible as it will keep your face dry. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Worth it:** Absolutely not, buy something from Arc’teryx or Nike ACG if you can, the colors are super nice and I do like the details. This jacket, like the quilted work shirt, might hold up better than I expect, but if you are a more outdoorsy person, or want the best performance money can buy, look elsewhere. \n",

      "So I put together a $500 *Expansion* Kit that assumes you have spring/summer basics covered, but would like to branch out from there. A little bolder, a little less traditional, but still focused on versatility and value.  This kit is eight items, all of which can be worn with just about everything else in the kit, which means there's something like two dozen different combinations here.  Add it to the spring/summer staples you already have and it's an incredibly versatile, non-boring wardrobe.\n",

These were an old favorite when they came out; I've had pairs from previous years are they are decently sturdy for cheap. A 9\" inseam is a little long for my liking but most will find it comfortably hitting above the knee. The navy-ish and khaki colors would go a long way for versatility. \n",

This is a nice option if you need to dress up a little bit past t-shirts but still keep it breezy. Apparently they run a bit large, so keep in mind. Either of the 2 options in blue would probably be the most versatile. \n",

MORE 'QLO; pretty good price to quality ratio on these, can take the abuse of summer and not too expensive. If I was starting from nothing I'd go with 00 WHITE, 03 GREY and 54 GREEN which would all work with the two short selections from above.\n",

      "The fez, named after the Moroccan city Fez, is a felt hat popularized during the Ottoman period. It has stood the test of time as a surefire sign of impeccable style and will undoubtedly continue to do so. Unfortunately, it is seldom mentioned what a remarkably versatile piece of headwear the fez truly is. Appropriate occasions can range anywhere from a formal black tie event, to a walk through the park, or even game day at your local sports bar. I created this guide to inspire utilization of the fez and hopefully help you find a fez that best suits your needs. \n",

      "[Here](https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7121/7030882785_6b9227a298_b.jpg) is an example of a formal fez. The black tassel is the perfect subtle complement to a black tie, or dark rimmed monocle. Gold tassels are slightly less formal and  generally reserved for pairings with navy or brown jackets. The key thing to look out for with a formal fez is the purity of the burgundy. There's an old saying that goes \"A fez that's not burgundy, is a fez that will burden thee.\" Abide by this or be prepared to get laughed out of a room with any serious fez enthusiasts. As far as price goes, you should be willing to spend $300-$800 for a handsome fez you can wear time and time again. \n",

      "Vintage / throwback fez are super fun to wear out to parties! [Here](https://bid.auctionbymayo.com/images/lot/4098/4098022_0.jpg) is a prime example of such a fez you could paint the town burgundy in. Note the 1/4\" stem to tassel combo, the ornate jewel, and gorgeous lettering. Though the burgundy is slightly faded, it still makes for a nice fez somewhere between casual and upscale. Expect to pay $158-$273 for such a fez. \n",
      "\n",
      "[Here](https://www.kangaroomfg.com/assets/images/products/Products/FEZ-Maroon-1-website.jpg) is a more leisurely, sporty fez.

I would not pay any less than $120 for such a fez or you will notice the [drop in burgundy quality](http://www.sillyjokes.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_5409.jpg).

Get 'em in tan if you want something versatile and safe, red or orange if you want something bolder (but less versatile).  Stay away from black - it's a terrible choice for casual footwear, especially in the summer.  The navy boat shoes are almost sold out, unfortunately, but there are most sizes still available in the other colors.

Put some rawhide leather laces in them to steal a look from the J.Crew summer catalog.  The boat shoes fit true-to-size and the sneakers fit 1/2 size big, according to the reviews on the website.

These aren't the greatest polos in the world, but they're available in a wide range of colors and sizes (including tall sizes).  Mainline Lands' End shirts are cut generously, so size down one.

As an alternative (since the updated LE code doesn't have a minimum order anymore), [these Old Navy slim-fit polos](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=26068&vid=1&pid=898381) are $9, come in tall sizes, and a wide range of colors.  From comments in a previous thread, they're not great quality and run very long through the body.  They're also a 60/40 cotton-poly blend.  Either way, whether it's LE or ON, I recommend getting one in a dark color (charcoal or dark olive), one in the red/yellow family, and one in the blue/green family.  Figure out what colors would work best with the shorts you're ordering below.  Don't order a blue polo and blue shorts, for example, or red and red.

I wasn't sure how these fit, so I live-chatted with Norma from LL Bean, Paula from Lands' End Canvas and Hector from J.Crew to get some measurements for comparison.

      "My girlfriend actually found me this jacket, she knew I wanted a military type color parka, ideally I wanted one with 3 pockets at least (1 interior), a interior waistband with cinches that wouldn't show ( no draw strings on the outside). And the faux fur had to be removable or 100% tasteful. Unfornately at under the $200 mark I couldn't really find many jackets that fit the bill for me, alpha slim fit n3b's are too shiny (noted many times in this subreddit), most of the asos offerings don't look timeless and returns would be a hassle. Then there's the parka's that look like fall jackets that I want to wear in the winter.\n",

It has snap buttons all the way down and typically I just button the first 5 when I'm walking around and unbutton the last one when driving for comfort (but its not totally uncomfortable with it buttoned). I can wear it with a thick hoodie if I wanted and it wouldn't look any bigger than it does, nor would it be constricting.\n",

They both fit fine in one pocket or one in each without looking like the jacket is being pulled down by them. I think the only way this jacket could be better is a chest pocket and a waistband with cinches but for $60 its a steal IMO. The length of the jacket in the front and back hits about where you would expect a pair of jeans back pockets to reach.\n",

I buy them when they have those stupidly-cheap sales + coupon events ($10/pr., I generally buy 6pr. at a time) because I was always a poor student, but I've now found myself making money and wanting to have better jeans so that they can hang around for longer when I start to really work them in.\n",

With Old Navy the fit between pairs of jeans within the same family/style/cut varies a fair bit so I can find pairs that fit me *juuuust* right, but Levis have consistently been too tight in the thighs or too baggy in the waist/butt. Haven't tried Nudies, although my little brother loves 'em, I doubt I could/would shoehorn myself into a set.\n",

      "These pants are the most comfortable pair of pants I own.  Moreso than any of my joggers or my BR Traveler jeans.  ABC means anti-ball-crushing, which just means they have a significant amount of stretch and are quite fitted.\n",
      "\n",
      "I comfortably wear a size 34 waist in Banana Republic Traveler/GAP jeans and I had to size a full size up to a 36 which is snug.  The inseam on the talls is every bit of 37\" and 34\" on the regulars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall design of the pants is fantastic.  It's not an over-the-top technical pant but it has some nice-to-have features.  There's a back zipper pocket inside the regular pocket which I stash my passport in when I travel. There's also a pocket within the front left pocket which is the exact size of an iPhone plus.  If you cuff your pants there's a little reflective strip which I guess lets drivers know they're about to hit something at night and a tiny little lululemon logo halfway up the leg that lets them know you can afford to sue during the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The matte finish on these pants does not look like it's a stretch material until you get very close.  Boy, do I appreciate the material.  It's so flexible and breathable.  I've been much more cool and comfortable in these in 100 degree heat than a pair of khaki shorts.  The downside: the light khaki gets dirty easily.  On the other hand, you can wash something off of them with water while wearing them and they'll be dry 10 minutes later.\n",

      "Upon receiving these pants, they are so very obviously Old Navy's version of the ABC pant, complete with reflective cuff strip. That's not a bad thing though: they seemingly cut corners in all the right places.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered these pants in both a 34x36 and a 36x36.  The 36x36 is snug enough in the waist.  Typically in my experience for Old Navy pants the waist and inseam are both a little bit smaller than a GAP/BR pant in the same size, which is why I ordered the size up as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall fit of these is a little more traditional than the ABC with what feels like more rise and a little more material on the back end.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fit and finish of these pants is a more what you expect of Old Navy.  The seams are more obvious.  They used a plastic button instead of a metal one.  The insides of the pockets are just plain mesh and there are no fancy pockets.  The fabric is very close to the ABC pant but just different enough that it looks a little stretchy when you're not as close.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered these pants with 40% off plus another 30% from signing up for emails, bringing them to under $19.  That's a steal for what i got in my opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "I would highly recommend either of these pants to anyone.  If you're a buy-a-lot-of-clothes-and-hardly-wear-them type of person, I'd go with the Old Navy's for hot summer days when you need pants.  If you're the kind of person who travels a lot and needs a single pair of pants to last you every occasion for a week in the summer, spring for the ABC pants.\n",

Ironically, the two brands that fit best so far are Old Navy and Uniqlo. I have more money to work with in my budget and I'm looking for 'premium' brands that have a similar fit. Mainly shirts which are 38-40 in the chest but around a 30-31 in the waist. Old Navy smalls fit me great. I'm looking at Uniqlo's site right now too and it looks like their medium should fit me. Banana Republic mediums, on the other hand, are too long and wide in the waist, and their smalls are too tight in the chest. J-Crew has similar sizing.

      "We took a medium, large, x-large, and xx-large tall t-shirts from Old Navy, put them through the wash once on cold and let them air dry. We tore out the seams so we could obtain the actual measurements they used to cut the cloth. With the sample Reddit provided, body size boards were constructed based on averages of each of the categories that our algorithm generated. The boards are correct in shoulder, chest, and torso.\n",

      "There wasn’t much shrinkage along the torso. The chest for L-XXL lost 0.25 inches, .5 inches, and 1 inch respectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Adjustments**\n",
      "For the sizing boards, we made certain adjustments to take into account that clothing is never made based on skin tight measurements. For example, we expanded the chest by 2 inches because you need some breathing room and an inflated chest from a deep breath can make that difference.\n",

      "**Overview**\n",
      "Old Navy’s tall t-shirts were all very wide. The construction, especially around the sleeves wasn’t particularly well done. The bottom of the sleeves where the seam is was extremely short. This leads to some weird folding in the shirt when you lift your arms.\n",

      "http://i.imgur.com/Z6tRCqE.jpg\n",
      "\n",
      "The fabric was also thinner than some higher quality t-shirts would be. It’s one thing to be rocking nipple points, but another thing to have your nipples visible through the shirt. These t-shirts are likely to show holes much sooner than t-shirts with a higher GSM. However, at $7-10 a shirt, they’re cheap. Replacing them every year would not be an unfeasible option.\n",

      "***Conclusions***\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Navy medium is obviously too long for Reddit Size 1 and is likely to be a little tight in the chest. Medium may be a passable fit for Reddit Size 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Navy large is probably *too* large for both Reddit Size 1 & 2. It’s way too long for Reddit Size 1 and it will be pretty wide for Reddit Size 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Navy x-large is somewhat long for Reddit Size 3. This bucket of sizing contained a large variance in torso lengths. So if the x-large fits the chest & shoulders, you can consider trying this to see if the torso length is too much or just right. This is likely to be a little small for Reddit Size 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Old Navy xx-large was massive like a tent. A family of chipmunks could live in this t-shirt with a Reddit Size 4. Unless you have the girth, your shirt is going to flap around even if you have the torso length. \n",
      "\n",
      "As I explained in our previous post. The Gods of Greece bucket is for people who are both really tall and really swole. It also contained way too few data samples for us to make a meaningful sizing. We will update if we ever feel like we can draw some decent sizes out of the data. Rest assured, you are not forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Final Comments**\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve received a few offers for help and we just wanted to say that while we greatly appreciate the offers of assistance, the best way you can help is to submit your [data here]( http://heightist.com/) if you haven’t already. Or if you know tall people with tall people problems, send this their way if you think they will be interested. Associative rule learning is an analytical method that is meant for large data sets. While Reddit has been awesome and gotten us this far, we are still short on the quantity of data necessary. \n",

      "Description: From a variety of gifts and other returns-without-receipts, I wound up with a few hundred dollars in Banana Republic \"merchandise certificates\" a while back. If you are unfamiliar with this, it is the new policy at Gap-owned stores where if you return an item without a receipt, they will issue you a \"gift card\" which cannot be used online, cannot be redeemed for cash or used to purchase a real gift card, and must be used with a photo ID (ostensibly to prevent resale on Cardpool-like sites). There was little I really wanted with almost 1000$ in BR cash, so I wanted to sell the gift card online for real money. If any of you are in a similar position, I believe I have found a solution after a few weeks of experimenting.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Use your MC to purchase anything at the store. Be sure to ask for a gift receipt with your purchase (I'm in NYC and 6/7 of the BRs I went to were okay with giving me a gift receipt)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Go back to a store later and \"return\" the item you just bought with the gift receipt. The store will then give you a real gift card.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Sell the gift card online/give as a gift/etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the 10 or so transactions I made, there was one person who did let me use my MC to buy a gift card, but everyone else was extremely adamant about not letting me.\n",

      "\n",
      "The long sleeve tee fits just a tiny bit loose on me, but that's because I'm a skinny skeleton of a guy (5'6\", 126 lbs). If you're even a bit muscular and an inch or two taller, the fit would be perfect. Their fabric quality is the same as their other stuff.\n",

I'm also not going to be constantly thinking about lifting my shirt when walking out and about.  I also spent $100 on that belt which makes me sick now that I think about it.

      "I am tall (6'2\") and very skinny (~150 lb) in USA. If I go to a clothing store around my house looking for pants, they will not have my size. I have to order pants online. Which leads me to my first question: Who even makes pants that are size 28/34? They seem impossible to find.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've noticed that many brands have different sizing. eg. sometimes a 30 waist will fit me and other times even a 28 will be too big. Recently, I bought two pairs of pants from Old Navy. Both the same type of pants, straight leg khakis. One is a 30/32 and the other is a 30/34. (30 is the smallest waist size they had with 34 length) The 30/32 fits my waist perfectly, the 30/34 is so big I have to awkwardly bunch my pants up with a belt or they will fall off.\n",

      "I put them both down on the floor, measured them out, and the 30/34's waist was like maybe 3/4 of an inch bigger than the 30/32.

Is there a company that would, say, make it so I could measure my waist, order than size, and get an accurate measuring pair of pants?\n",

      "Description: It seems like every so often a post pops up with a Canadian asking for the best places to shop, and being a canuck myself I figured it would be very useful having a comprehensive list of quality retailers for us. Now, the problem is, many shops (ie: ASOS, Karmaloop, etc.) offer good deals, but by the time you add on international shipping, plus duties and taxes the deals aren't really worth it any more. So, with this guide, I think it'd be a good idea to limit it to either brick and mortar stores that are common in Canada or online stores that ship out from Canada, thus eliminating duties and whatnot. Here's an example of what I figure would be a good layout for things, maybe just put some details, what's good, what isn't etc. This is my first time doing this, so if anyone has any additions just let me know and I'll add it to the OP.\n",

My work clothes and my street clothes tend to draw from the same pile, as post college didn’t have a lot of clothes and I hate the concept of having two separate wardrobes so to speak. I am still in the process of filling my closet, as I graduated within the last 3 years, but as of now it contains brands such as Todd Snyder, A Kind of Guise, Howlin, Gitman Bros, Brain Dead, Alden and Yuketen for shoes etc. and where applicable, I will make comparisons to these brands as I see fit. I will also say I believe the aim of Aime is one hype piece per drop, rather than filling your closet, like I’ve done here. Is this a recommendation to buy any of these clothes?

      "\n",
      "My first Aime piece, a birthday gift to myself at the end of 2020. I am a huge Clarks fan, as I love the history (grew up around Jamaican immigrants when I was a kid in NY) and the versatility in my work and street fits. I have owned 2 wallabees before this: a Todd Snyder collaboration and a normal pair, and these are my favorite clarks by far. These are significantly more comfortable than both Clarks (especially the TS ones) and have a higher level of formality because of the casentino wool that I really appreciate. They really shine with gray sweatpants, but look at home with sweaters and chinos in the office. That being said, I do think the color of the maple suede clarks are a bit more versatile than these tan ones, so I reach for them far less often than I’d like. The casentino wool, while nice, is also a bit much to clean and because of this you can’t really wear them in the winter, which is when you’d like to wear wool shoes. \n",

I have owned several cardigans and sweaters from Howlin, Uniqlo, and SNS Herring, and aside from SNS Herring the ALD cardigan blew the others out of the water.

Aside from the functionality, I love the colorful tree pattern and have yet to see anything even remotely similar. I frequently wear this in the office and in day to day activities.

I also love the colors; I own the paprika and the parmesan, and I really like how modern the knit looks and how deeply colored the yarns are.

This jacket is everything I’ve ever wanted and more. Perfectly cut so it doesn’t look oversized when placed over a T-shirt, but can fit a hoodie underneath. Longer than an average chore, so you can play with proportions with low rise or high rise trousers. Love the versatility; I wear it over an OCBD for interviews (it’s my lucky coat) and over t-shirts for something more casual. I love the details, the corduroy trim on the collar and sleeves, the five pockets, and the ALD/Drakes patch on the pocket. This is truly my favorite piece in my closet and one of my favorite garments I’ve ever handled. \n",

That being said, it is my most worn jacket by far, it’s great for blocking wind, pretty warm, and  waterproof, in combination with a sweater from above I can wear at 10 degrees F and still be comfortable. It does “shed” some fibers from time to time, so I’m interested in how this piece will age in time. Not to mention, I really think any quilted jacket can achieve what this jacket does for my closet. However, I do like the general size as it’s a great midlayer, I love the buttoned vents at the back to increase airflow, I love that you can roll up the sleeves, and I like the collar. I will also add this in the jackets favor; I recently bought the Todd Snyder quilted jacket and pants, and I returned them immediately. The Woolrich jacket is significantly warmer and more durable, while the TS version is “softer” which makes me afraid of tearing. Was it worth the entire price difference? Not at all, but there is a quality difference worthy of mention. \n",

This is what ALD/Drakes does really well imo, and it slaps as a garment. Love the quality of the pullover, not soft by any means, but not uncomfortable and incredibly hearty. I reach for it so often, especially in my wardrobe as a lot of it tends to skew more formal. Coffee with the SO? Movies with friends? Going to my local bookstore? Toss on the fleece, jeans and some Indy boots. Running to the grocery store? Fleece, sweats and sneakers. I also love wearing it on top of a button up or even another sweater for office wear. I can also fit a hoodie underneath which makes it great for more layered fits on colder days. Love the embroidery, and I love the structure of the collar.

I love the unstructured silhouette, the 6x2 double breasted buttons, the large lapels that add a really grand air when the jacket is open, but significantly more subdued when the jacket is closed. Love the midnight blue color. It really does look black in iridescent yellow lighting and the blue adds a certain level of panache when seen in the correct lighting. The patch pockets do make this jacket less formal, so I would not recommend wearing this in a setting in which the black tie details matter. However the patch pockets aren’t super noticeable unless someone is looking for it, and I think it does add some personality to the jacket. That being said, this is a fun jacket and  the pants are also well made. However the rise is quite high, not a complaint just something to note. \n",

      "So did a lot of research on this one and while I copped it, I would not recommend anyone else do the same. The colors are great, the best part of this jacket by far. After the woolrich drop this year, I looked high and low for something similar and couldn’t find something I liked that hit the same tone (aside from the Arc’teryx rush or the arc x beams collab). The jacket is only a 2L so it’s not going to last as long as a 3L jacket, nor be as waterproof,  and in terms of pure utility, you can definitely find a better jacket for a cheaper price. Now to be honest I’m not much of an outdoorsman, so I took the color over the functionality, but for my purposes it works. I have worn this jacket pretty much every day since I bought it two weeks ago and it holds up well in rain conditions. I walked for about 2 hours with it on and while my bottom half was soaking wet, my top half was completely dry. It is not a warm jacket, as it is only a shell, but it does a decent job of blocking the wind (even the hood) and I appreciate the armpit zips for increased breathability. I also like the microfiber detailing in the pocket and the neckline. The stashable hood also makes it very versatile. The hood itself works, but sadly is only 1 point adjustable, so it’s not the best fit for your head, but certainly not terrible as it will keep your face dry. \n",
      "\n",
      "**Worth it:** Absolutely not, buy something from Arc’teryx or Nike ACG if you can, the colors are super nice and I do like the details. This jacket, like the quilted work shirt, might hold up better than I expect, but if you are a more outdoorsy person, or want the best performance money can buy, look elsewhere. \n",

      " - [JCP Arizona Chino Shorts x 2](http://www.jcpenney.com/p/arizona-9-inseam-flat-front-shorts/ppr5007179007?) - $20 (2 pairs) - can order to your local store to avoid paying shipping. These were an old favorite when they came out; I've had pairs from previous years are they are decently sturdy for cheap. A 9\" inseam is a little long for my liking but most will find it comfortably hitting above the knee. The navy-ish and khaki colors would go a long way for versatility. \n",

      "\n",
      " - [Uniqlo - Linen Cotton Short Sleeve Shirt](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men-linen-cotton-short-sleeve-shirt-183598.html) - $14.90. This is a nice option if you need to dress up a little bit past t-shirts but still keep it breezy. Apparently they run a bit large, so keep in mind. Either of the 2 options in blue would probably be the most versatile. \n",

      " - [Uniqlo - Dry Packaged Crewneck x 3](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/men-packaged-dry-crewneck-short-sleeve-t-shirt-180700.html) - $17.70. MORE 'QLO; pretty good price to quality ratio on these, can take the abuse of summer and not too expensive. If I was starting from nothing I'd go with 00 WHITE, 03 GREY and 54 GREEN which would all work with the two short selections from above.\n",
      "\n",

      " - [Van's Authentic](https://www.shoes.com/vans-authentic-sneaker/288665/1273088) - ~~$44.95~~ $37.48 with code FLASH17 and free shipping. Simple canvas kicks, a handful of other colors but I'm partial to Off-White or True White. \n",

      "Title: Introductory guide to fez\n",
      "Description: The fez, named after the Moroccan city Fez, is a felt hat popularized during the Ottoman period. It has stood the test of time as a surefire sign of impeccable style and will undoubtedly continue to do so. Unfortunately, it is seldom mentioned what a remarkably versatile piece of headwear the fez truly is. Appropriate occasions can range anywhere from a formal black tie event, to a walk through the park, or even game day at your local sports bar. I created this guide to inspire utilization of the fez and hopefully help you find a fez that best suits your needs. \n",
      "\n",
      "[Here](https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7121/7030882785_6b9227a298_b.jpg) is an example of a formal fez. The black tassel is the perfect subtle complement to a black tie, or dark rimmed monocle. Gold tassels are slightly less formal and  generally reserved for pairings with navy or brown jackets. The key thing to look out for with a formal fez is the purity of the burgundy. There's an old saying that goes \"A fez that's not burgundy, is a fez that will burden thee.\" Abide by this or be prepared to get laughed out of a room with any serious fez enthusiasts. As far as price goes, you should be willing to spend $300-$800 for a handsome fez you can wear time and time again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Vintage / throwback fez are super fun to wear out to parties! [Here](https://bid.auctionbymayo.com/images/lot/4098/4098022_0.jpg) is a prime example of such a fez you could paint the town burgundy in. Note the 1/4\" stem to tassel combo, the ornate jewel, and gorgeous lettering. Though the burgundy is slightly faded, it still makes for a nice fez somewhere between casual and upscale. Expect to pay $158-$273 for such a fez. \n",
      "\n",
      "[Here](https://www.kangaroomfg.com/assets/images/products/Products/FEZ-Maroon-1-website.jpg) is a more leisurely, sporty fez. The unpresumptuos half inch stem and breathable top make for a cool, casual summer look. I would not pay any less than $120 for such a fez or you will notice the [drop in burgundy quality](http://www.sillyjokes.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_5409.jpg). That bold black trim nearly makes up for it though.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you found this guide helpful! Please let me know if you are aware of any high quality fez vendors online. I am a bit of a fez snob and generally eat the heavy shipping costs of having my fez hats expedited from Morocco but am willing to try some other milliners so long as the hat is guaranteed proper burgundy.\n",

(Tangent: I wore a short-sleeved shirt that was navy and had tiny white dots on it and one of my coworkers was shocked I’d wear something so “formal”.)\n",

Get 'em in tan if you want something versatile and safe, red or orange if you want something bolder (but less versatile).  Stay away from black - it's a terrible choice for casual footwear, especially in the summer.  The navy boat shoes are almost sold out, unfortunately, but there are most sizes still available in the other colors.  For something more sneaker-ey, [these Sperry-CVO-knockoffs](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/StylePage-393321_X5.html?amp;CM_MERCH=REC-_-CVPP-_-GGT-_-2-_-393321-_-401124) are $21.97, available in tan and navy in a bunch of sizes, and will still qualify you for free shipping.  Put some rawhide leather laces in them to steal a look from the J.Crew summer catalog.  The boat shoes fit true-to-size and the sneakers fit 1/2 size big, according to the reviews on the website.  For all the LE stuff, you can return for free at any Sears store that carries LE (which is almost all of them).  Budget in $3 for some Gold Bond powder and wear them sockless.\n",

These aren't the greatest polos in the world, but they're available in a wide range of colors and sizes (including tall sizes).  Mainline Lands' End shirts are cut generously, so size down one.  For reference, I'm 6'2 and 185 lbs, and I wear a medium-tall comfortably.  [Tailored fit is here](https://canvas.landsend.com/pp/mens-tailored-short-sleeve-original-banded-mesh-polo-shirt~229211_-1.html?bcc=y&action=order_more&sku_0=::HNB&CM_MERCH=search-_-401625&origin=search), but (1) some of the colors are $12.97, and (2) they don't come in tall sizes.  As an alternative (since the updated LE code doesn't have a minimum order anymore), [these Old Navy slim-fit polos](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=26068&vid=1&pid=898381) are $9, come in tall sizes, and a wide range of colors.  From comments in a previous thread, they're not great quality and run very long through the body.  They're also a 60/40 cotton-poly blend.  Either way, whether it's LE or ON, I recommend getting one in a dark color (charcoal or dark olive), one in the red/yellow family, and one in the blue/green family.  Figure out what colors would work best with the shorts you're ordering below.  Don't order a blue polo and blue shorts, for example, or red and red.  For a starter kit, you'll want to make sure you can wear everything interchangeably with everything else.  There's a color-matching guide in the sidebar if you need it. \n",

I'd get one pair in khaki and one pair in either blue or red (but see my note about colors above - make sure you're buying a versatile kit where everything is interchangeable with everything else).  I wasn't sure how these fit, so I live-chatted with Norma from LL Bean, Paula from Lands' End Canvas and Hector from J.Crew to get some measurements for comparison.  For a size 32 pair of 9\" inseam shorts, these LL Beans have a 34\" waist measurement and 23 3/8\" leg opening.

And the faux fur had to be removable or 100% tasteful. Unfornately at under the $200 mark I couldn\\'t really find many jackets that fit the bill for me, alpha slim fit n3b\\'s are too shiny (noted many times in this subreddit), most of the asos offerings don\\'t look timeless and returns would be a hassle. Then there\\'s the parka\\'s that look like fall jackets that I want to wear in the winter.\\n\\nThis jacket is currently something like $50-$60, original ticket price is $95. \\n\\n\\n**Fit**\\nI bought a medium and wear medium tee shirts, medium tailored fit BR dress shirts. Its slightly tight at the bottom button due to my somewhat larger than average butt. It has snap buttons all the way down and typically I just button the first 5 when I\\'m walking around and unbutton the last one when driving for comfort (but its not totally uncomfortable with it buttoned). I can wear it with a thick hoodie if I wanted and it wouldn\\'t look any bigger than it does, nor would it be constricting.\\n\\n**quality** \\nItem is what I would consider \"good\" for its price. There is no lose or bad stitching but I did find 4-5 random threads that I cut off.

I have a really fat wallet right now (just bought a elephant slim wallet though to replace it with) and a HTC One M8 phone. They both fit fine in one pocket or one in each without looking like the jacket is being pulled down by them. I think the only way this jacket could be better is a chest pocket and a waistband with cinches but for $60 its a steal IMO. The length of the jacket in the front and back hits about where you would expect a pair of jeans back pockets to reach.\\n\\n',\n",

The first store sold Levi's and LP records, but expanded rapidly.  The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.\\n\\nIn 1983, Gap acquired Banana Republic, formerly safari-themed clothing retailer, and eventually rebranded it as a mainstream luxury clothing brand.  Gap took on a more upscale image in the 90s, and created a less-expensive division of Gap, which was rebranded as Old Navy.  Millard Drexler, was responsible for Gap's upscale image in the 90s, but eventually left the company and went on to become the CEO of J.Crew.\\n\\nGap/Banana Republic/Old Navy all have various images and are marketed toward varying age groups.  However, one thing that they are all well-known for is their pricing strategy and frequent sales.  Gap also done some notable collaborations, including [Gap x GQ](http://www.gap.com/browse/category.do?cid=99773) and Banana Republic did a Mad Men collection a few years back.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis is a space to talk about the good, the bad, and the ugly.  Here you can write a raving review or a scathing critique.  Did you have a good customer service experience?  Bad luck with quality control/quality in general?  How's the fit?

With Old Navy the fit between pairs of jeans within the same family/style/cut varies a fair bit so I can find pairs that fit me *juuuust* right, but Levis have consistently been too tight in the thighs or too baggy in the waist/butt.

I\\'m usually a XL in tops from Gap, J.Crew, Merona, etc. My chest size is 46. The coat a bit looked a bit boxy before I put it on but was less bulky than I thought once I tried it on. Once I put on a cardigan, the coat was snug without being too tight.\\n\\nThe sleeves are a bit long. I wear a 35\" sleeve and then lined with corduroy. It could be that it was designed to be cuffed.\\n\\n[Fit pics here](http://imgur.com/a/IIUXX)\\n\\n**Quality**\\n\\nRight off the bat, I was impressed with the coats quality being from Old Navy. The coat\\'s stitching is mostly solid with the exception of the cuff lining as you can see in [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/HwNx1lph.jpg). The canvas feels decently durable and seems like it could hold up to a decent amount of wear. \\n\\n**Final Thoughts**\\n\\nI\\'m in general, impressed by this coat despite its Old Navy brand.

       " '**Introduction**\\n\\nI needed a pair of versatile long pants for a summer trip to the Midwest that I could dress up or down.  The problem is, I\\'m 6\\'8 and very sweaty.  When a friend raved about the ABC pant on Facebook, I saw that they carried a tall size online and decided to check them out in person before dropping $128.  I found out that lululemon also carries the tall size in stores and after trying them on, I immediately pulled out my credit card.\\n\\n**ABC Pant** | [Regular](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-pants/ABC-Pant-Regular/_/prod3470051) | [Tall](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-pants/ABC-Pant-Tall/_/prod3470052)\\n\\nBrand: **lululemon**\\n\\nMSRP: **$128 USD**\\n\\nPrice Paid: **$96 USD**\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n* Quality\\n* Color selection\\n* Versatility\\n* Comfort\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* Price\\n* Visible logo\\n* Easily dirty\\n\\n[Photos](http://imgur.com/a/z8YQN) \\n\\n(The colors are way off, [desert sand on the website](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-pants/ABC-Pant-Tall/_/prod3470052))\\n\\n**Review**\\n\\nThese pants are the most comfortable pair of pants I own.  Moreso than any of my joggers or my BR Traveler jeans.  ABC means anti-ball-crushing, which just means they have a significant amount of stretch and are quite fitted.\\n\\nI comfortably wear a size 34 waist in Banana Republic Traveler/GAP jeans and I had to size a full size up to a 36 which is snug.  The inseam on the talls is every bit of 37\" and 34\" on the regulars.\\n\\nThe overall design of the pants is fantastic.  It\\'s not an over-the-top technical pant but it has some nice-to-have features.  There\\'s a back zipper pocket inside the regular pocket which I stash my passport in when I travel. There\\'s also a pocket within the front left pocket which is the exact size of an iPhone plus.  If you cuff your pants there\\'s a little reflective strip which I guess lets drivers know they\\'re about to hit something at night and a tiny little lululemon logo halfway up the leg that lets them know you can afford to sue during the day.\\n\\nThe matte finish on these pants does not look like it\\'s a stretch material until you get very close.  Boy, do I appreciate the material.  It\\'s so flexible and breathable.  I\\'ve been much more cool and comfortable in these in 100 degree heat than a pair of khaki shorts.  The downside: the light khaki gets dirty easily.  On the other hand, you can wash something off of them with water while wearing them and they\\'ll be dry 10 minutes later.\\n\\nI ended up having my sister buy a second pair for me in Canada.  The Canadian prices are the same as the US prices but in CAD, so my second pair was $96 USD.\\n\\n**Go-Dry Slim Performance Pants** | [Link](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?vid=1&pid=435081032)\\n\\nBrand: **Old Navy**\\n\\nMSRP: **$45 USD**\\n\\nPrice Paid: **$19 USD**\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n* Inseam selection\\n* Price\\n* Versatility\\n* Comfort\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* Durability\\n* Functionality\\n\\n[Photos](http://imgur.com/a/03hUr)\\n\\n(The colors are way off, [olive on the website](http://oldnavy.gap.com/browse/product.do?vid=1&pid=435081032) but the pants are greener even than what they show)\\n\\n**Review:**\\n\\nUpon receiving these pants, they are so very obviously Old Navy\\'s version of the ABC pant, complete with reflective cuff strip. That\\'s not a bad thing though: they seemingly cut corners in all the right places.\\n\\nI ordered these pants in both a 34x36 and a 36x36.  The 36x36 is snug enough in the waist.  Typically in my experience for Old Navy pants the waist and inseam are both a little bit smaller than a GAP/BR pant in the same size, which is why I ordered the size up as well.\\n\\nThe overall fit of these is a little more traditional than the ABC with what feels like more rise and a little more material on the back end.\\n\\nThe fit and finish of these pants is a more what you expect of Old Navy.  The seams are more obvious.  They used a plastic button instead of a metal one.  The insides of the pockets are just plain mesh and there are no fancy pockets.  The fabric is very close to the ABC pant but just different enough that it looks a little stretchy when you\\'re not as close.\\n\\nI ordered these pants with 40% off plus another 30% from signing up for emails, bringing them to under $19.  That\\'s a steal for what i got in my opinion.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nI would highly recommend either of these pants to anyone.  If you\\'re a buy-a-lot-of-clothes-and-hardly-wear-them type of person, I\\'d go with the Old Navy\\'s for hot summer days when you need pants.  If you\\'re the kind of person who travels a lot and needs a single pair of pants to last you every occasion for a week in the summer, spring for the ABC pants.',\n",

       " 'Hello Reddit. Today we are going to bring you post number 2. After tweaking our algo, we are starting to see why some individuals are likely to have problems with their t-shirt fits. Up at the bat this time around is Old Navy.\\n\\nPrevious posts:\\n\\n[Initial Post](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/21yc1i/tall_people_with_clothing_fit_problems_lets_see/)\\n\\n[American Apparel]( http://www.reddit.com/r/tallfashionadvice/comments/22q3p4/heightist_analysis_american_apparel_triblend/)\\n\\n\\n**Methodology**\\nWe took a medium, large, x-large, and xx-large tall t-shirts from Old Navy, put them through the wash once on cold and let them air dry. We tore out the seams so we could obtain the actual measurements they used to cut the cloth. With the sample Reddit provided, body size boards were constructed based on averages of each of the categories that our algorithm generated. The boards are correct in shoulder, chest, and torso.\\n\\n**Shrinkage**\\nThere wasn’t much shrinkage along the torso. The chest for L-XXL lost 0.25 inches, .5 inches, and 1 inch respectively. \\n\\n**Adjustments**\\nFor the sizing boards, we made certain adjustments to take into account that clothing is never made based on skin tight measurements. For example, we expanded the chest by 2 inches because you need some breathing room and an inflated chest from a deep breath can make that difference.\\n\\n**Old Navy t-shirt sizes after air drying**\\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kRyI1Ds.png\\n\\n**Overview**\\nOld Navy’s tall t-shirts were all very wide. The construction, especially around the sleeves wasn’t particularly well done. The bottom of the sleeves where the seam is was extremely short. This leads to some weird folding in the shirt when you lift your arms.\\n\\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Z6tRCqE.jpg\\n\\nThe fabric was also thinner than some higher quality t-shirts would be.

Medium may be a passable fit for Reddit Size 2.\\n\\nThe Old Navy large is probably *too* large for both Reddit Size 1 & 2. It’s way too long for Reddit Size 1 and it will be pretty wide for Reddit Size 2.\\n\\nThe Old Navy x-large is somewhat long for Reddit Size 3. This bucket of sizing contained a large variance in torso lengths. So if the x-large fits the chest & shoulders, you can consider trying this to see if the torso length is too much or just right. This is likely to be a little small for Reddit Size 4.\\n\\nThe Old Navy xx-large was massive like a tent. A family of chipmunks could live in this t-shirt with a Reddit Size 4. Unless you have the girth, your shirt is going to flap around even if you have the torso length. \\n\\nAs I explained in our previous post. The Gods of Greece bucket is for people who are both really tall and really swole. It also contained way too few data samples for us to make a meaningful sizing.

       " 'From a variety of gifts and other returns-without-receipts, I wound up with a few hundred dollars in Banana Republic \"merchandise certificates\" a while back. If you are unfamiliar with this, it is the new policy at Gap-owned stores where if you return an item without a receipt, they will issue you a \"gift card\" which cannot be used online, cannot be redeemed for cash or used to purchase a real gift card, and must be used with a photo ID (ostensibly to prevent resale on Cardpool-like sites).

Honestly, at the time I was excited, but after taking 24 hours and sleeping on it, I am sort of less than thrilled.\\n\\nFor me the only things that I like from what I bought are the blue jeans which are from express.  Slim straight to accommodate my big calves.  And, the solid navy blue polo from banana republic.  I also like the shoes which are Cole Haan.  (Ignore the brown shoes in the last pictures, it\\'s some old brown shoes I had, don\\'t like them)\\n\\nI am honestly not really feeling the black jeans, nor the gray jeans.  I am more of a blue jeans guy, and I also have a darker wash on order.\\n\\nI think the navy polo with that light blue colored pocket looks very tacky and bad.  I didn\\'t want it, but my sister insisted.  I just think it looks bad.\\n\\nThe light blue polo I\\'m meh about.  Neither good nor bad.\\n\\nThe olive green t-shirt i\\'m also meh about.\\n\\nDuring the pictures she made me pose with my shirt up to expose the belt, because apparently \"that\\'s how you\\'re supposed to do it\"  I argued constantly that I\\'m not going to be walking around like that, I feel it looks douchey. I\\'m also not going to be constantly thinking about lifting my shirt when walking out and about.  I also spent $100 on that belt which makes me sick now that I think about it.  It\\'s a good belt though, but I feel it\\'s way overpriced.\\n\\nThe shirt sizes are all smalls except for the olive shirt.  In my old thread, I was wearing all large.  When I tried mediums, they still felt a little baggy, small was the only one that felt like it was the proper fit even if it was maybe a little tight.  I\\'m just worried that they will shrink with washing over time and become unwearable.\\n\\nOverall I\\'m not sure how I feel about all of this.  Like I said, only thing I like right now are the blue jeans and solid navy polo without the light pocket.\\n\\nThe thing with me is that I really don\\'t want to put too much thought into this.  I like blue jeans with washes similar to the picture and darker washes, and I know I can pretty much pair them with any type of shirt,  good enough for me.  I\\'m not a fashion model, I just wanted clothes that fit better.\\n\\nI still need to make an eye exam appointment to take care of those glasses and get better frames.  I know my current glasses look terrible.  Oh yeah and I also got a new haircut and styled it a little.  Also the styling sort of wore off with all the putting on and taking off of clothes.\\n\\nNew Pictures:  [https://imgur.com/a/1KiYdcx](https://imgur.com/a/1KiYdcx)\\n\\nEDIT:  Now I don\\'t know even more.  The shirts do feel a little tight, and maybe I should be going 1 size up.  Some of the shirts I tried in Medium kind of looked a little baggy.  I don\\'t know, it\\'s hard because I have a large chest.\\n\\nStill don\\'t know about the black and grey jeans.\\n\\nEDIT 2:  Tried on the clothes again and they are now growing on me.  I\\'m starting to like the black jeans and grey jeans.  All the jeans are super comfortable. The black jeans are Levi 511 and it\\'s weird because I tried on the same pair at a Sears today and the material wasn\\'t as comfortable as the one I have, which is from the actual levi store.\\n\\nAlso weird that the black jeans and grey jeans are 32x30 Slims,  but the blue jeans are 31x32 and fit similarly.  The blue jeans are slim straights though.  Still not sure between the 30 length and 32.  Some jeans I tried, the 32 was too long, and others it seemed fine.\\n\\nTomorrow I\\'m going to go back to the store and try the black and grey in 31 waist, and try them in 32 length too and experiment.\\n\\nLight blue polo is definitely too tight now that I tried it on again.  I also determined that the reason the solid navy polo fits better s because the material is stretchy, whereas the light blue is not.  I\\'ll play around with going 1 size up though on both.   Polo with the blue pocket is going back.\\n\\nBelt is probably going back too.',\n",

It’s a smart, sensible car and people are likely not going to clown you for driving one, in the same way people aren’t really going to clown you for going to Old Navy because you need chinos for work and you know they make a pair that fits you well.\\n\\nAre the hobbyists here more like the people who would want to drive a [Bugatti Chiron](https://www.bugatti.com/chiron/)? I don’t think so, unless it’s the tiny, tiny percentage of this subreddit who have both the interest and the funds to buy couture or hyper high-end luxury. I think the hobbyists here fit far more into the person who buys a [GR Yaris](https://toyotagazooracing.com/gr/yaris/). The car is still practicable (it even has back seats!) despite being a significant markup from the base model for a number of features only the hobbyist is going to really care about.\\n\\nOverall, this disconnect tends to come out in various ways here, but the most bitter spats cover either areas where there may be some amount of crossover between utilitarians and hobbyists, but the post represents something that may be a bridge too far for the utilitarians. KJ’s post was a bit of an inflection point for this: someone who clearly treats clothes as a hobby, rather than a means to an end, which appeared to strike a chord with a number of users that found it apparently incomprehensible that someone with a clothing hobby would be consistently buying clothing.\\n\\nWhether it’s willful or unintentional negligence, this leads to an dd disconnect, which may have something to do with how integral clothing is to everyday life. Someone might think “why would I even want to think for more than 5 minutes about what I want to buy/wear/look like.” However, this really only seems to apply in my experience to clothes as a hobby, whereas people seem to understand esotericism in hobbies like cars, building PCs, or alcohol.

       " \"I see a lot of misinformation and confusion on here when it comes to raw denim, so I thought it would be good to clear things up.\\n\\nFirst, what is raw denim? From Wikipedia:\\n>Dry or raw denim, as opposed to washed denim, is a denim fabric that is not washed after being dyed during its production.\\n\\nThe end. That's it.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n**Raw denim is not necessarily selvage**\\n\\nFor example, [Levi's 501 STF](http://us.levi.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2076855) are not selvage but are raw. Conversely, selvage jeans can come in various washes ([1](http://www.bonobos.com/premium-selvage-denim-for-men-saltwater-dark-wash) [2](http://www.jcrew.com/mens_category/pants/Denim/PRDOVR~38651/38651.jsp)) as well as raw.\\n\\nWhy are the two confused? Because way back in the day all jeans were selvage, raw, and unsanforized. Reproduction brands who create vintage or pseudo-vintage denim, hence tend use raw selvedge denim.\\n\\n**Raw denim will not necessarily shrink to fit**\\n\\nRaw denim can come sanforized or unsanforized. Sanforized is a fancy way of saying that your denim is pre-shrunk, and whether this is a desired trait is up to you. All denim will stretch with wear ~~, but unsanforized denim will stretch more so people typically size down with unsanforized denim~~. \\n\\n**Raw denim is not heavier weight than washed denim**\\n\\nRaw denim comes in all sorts of weights, from lightweight 9 oz to comically thick 22+ oz. I can't think of a washed denim off the top of my head in a 22+ oz weight, but there's no reason it couldn't exist. However, plenty of washed denim, especially work denim, comes in heavier weights like 15 oz.\\n\\nWhether heavy weight denim is good or bad is a different story, and mainly depends on your climate.\\n\\n**Raw denim does not look cleaner/more minimal than washed denim**\\n\\nI think when you say washed denim, people automatically imagine True Religion or Diesel. I often see raw denim recommended for a clean cut look, like pairing it with a blazer, but I think this is a mistake. Yes, raw denim looks very clean and minimal at [first](http://www.highsnobiety.com/files/2012/11/a-beginners-guide-to-raw-denim-2.jpg), but will quickly lose that clean slate look because of the [rapid fading](http://www.highsnobiety.com/files/2012/11/a-beginners-guide-to-raw-denim-3.jpg).\\n\\nYou can buy denim in a [dark wash](http://www.bonobos.com/dark-rinse-slim-straight-leg-denim-for-men-flatiron) which will not fade as fast as raw denim, and will maintain the clean slate look that many people want.\\n\\n**Raw denim does not mean higher quality**\\n\\nQuality can be a very fuzzy thing to talk about. It's important to remember that if you're spending $200 on raw denim and using quality to justify it, the quality comes from the fact that they're $200 jeans, not that they're raw. For example, $50 Old Navy jeans vs $50 Gap 1969 raw denim, and $200 Adriano Goldschmieds vs $200 APCs is a valid comparison. $50 Old Navy vs $200 APCs is not.\\n\\n**Raw denim does not imply a better cut or fit**\\n\\nI feel like this should be obvious, but the way a pair of jeans is shaped has nothing to do with it's wash.\\n\\n**Raw denim does not mean 100% cotton**\\n\\nI've seen raw denim with elastane and kevlar blended into it, although I have no experience with them. I would be curious to see how the elastane blends are, since raw denim normally comes quite rigid, and I personally find stretch denim to be more comfortable.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\nThis is not meant to imply raw denim is bad, but I see raw denim recommended on here far more often than I think it deserves, for many of the above reasons.\\n\\nSo what are the benefits of raw denim? Basically, if you are interested in:\\n\\n* [High contrast fading](http://denimhunters.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/P1010701.jpg)\\n* You like the history and authenticity of raw denim\\n\\nNow, if you happen to like the cut of Samurais or the weight of 25 oz denim and it just happens to be raw, whatever, I'm not saying to not get them. Many excellent denim brands do happen to only  produce raw jeans, but recommending Samurais because of their cut and denim quality is a different conversation than recommending them because they're raw.\\n\",\n",

They seem impossible to find.\\n\\nI\\'ve noticed that many brands have different sizing. eg. sometimes a 30 waist will fit me and other times even a 28 will be too big.

(30 is the smallest waist size they had with 34 length) The 30/32 fits my waist perfectly, the 30/34 is so big I have to awkwardly bunch my pants up with a belt or they will fall off.\\n\\nI put them both down on the floor, measured them out, and the 30/34\\'s waist was like maybe 3/4 of an inch bigger than the 30/32.

       " \"It seems like every so often a post pops up with a Canadian asking for the best places to shop, and being a canuck myself I figured it would be very useful having a comprehensive list of quality retailers for us. Now, the problem is, many shops (ie: ASOS, Karmaloop, etc.) offer good deals, but by the time you add on international shipping, plus duties and taxes the deals aren't really worth it any more. So, with this guide, I think it'd be a good idea to limit it to either brick and mortar stores that are common in Canada or online stores that ship out from Canada, thus eliminating duties and whatnot.

Both online and physical stores. \\n\\nThey are technically different stores, but they all are under the same name and one website houses them all. Both in terms of quality and price, Old Navy<Gap<Banana Republic. Old Navy can be good for cheap basics, but not too much more, imo. Their fits can be a bit large and boxy. Gap and BR are good, but their regular prices are a bit high for the quality, if you can get good sales they're worth it. Shipping is great with them in Canada, free with orders over $50 and free returns. I've dealt with them before and it's gone well.\\n\\n[**Club Monaco**](http://www.clubmonaco.ca/) \\n\\nMid range pricing. Online and physical. Free shipping over $150, inexpensive otherwise\\n\\nGreat sales, *everything* eventually gets marked down so if there's something you like there's a good chance that you can get it at a fraction of the cost if you're a bit patient. Definitely worth checking a real store if there's one near you, better deals and an unadvertised 20% student discount.\\n\\n[**Rooney**](http://www.rooneyshop.com/) \\n\\nBased in Montreal. They carry mid-high brands. Free shipping on all orders.\\n\\n[**Tate and Yoko**](http://tateandyoko.com/) \\n\\nAlso based in Montreal. Carry mostly premium denim lines. $5 shipping. No refunds though, returns are only for store credit. Womp.\\n\\n[**J Crew**](http://www.jcrew.com/index.jsp)\\n\\nMid range pricing. Physical and online. Ships to Canada for 9.95 flat rate, duty and tax included when you checkout, so no surprises when you checkout. \\n\\n[**Zara**](http://www.zara.com/ca/) \\n\\nFast-fashion, along the lines of H&M but a little nicer. The store has opened their ecommerce site, seems like they have better selection to what they offer in store.\\n\\n[**H&M**](http://www.hm.com/ca/) \\n\\nNo online shopping, but many large cities have at least one. Many on here tend to be torn on H&M. They offer cheap, mostly good looking items (fast-fashion kind of thing), and the fit is usually good but the quality can be hit and miss. I like them for the most part, and they're good for experimenting with new looks before you go and drop big coin on a nice piece.\\n\\n[**SSense**](http://www.ssense.com) \\n\\nHigh fashion, designer stuff mainly. Some cool stuff, but too expensive or too out there for most on here, I'd guess.\\n\\n[**JM**](http://www.jm.ca/) \\n\\nMade in Canada underwear. They sent me an item with the security tags with them still attached and sent me a replacement for free, for the inconvenience. Good customer service. \\n\\n[**Four Horsemen**](http://www.fourhorsemen.ca/) \\n\\nMid-high pricing, nicer stuff. Based out of Victoria BC. Free shipping over $200, 10 bucks otherwise. No returns, only exchanges or store credit.\\n\\n[**Frank and Oak**](http://www.frankandoak.com/)\\n\\nA different route. Invite only, low-mid tier, mainly basics and such. Free shipping both ways (I think they're out of Montreal?), so no big risk. I've heard mainly good from them.\\n\\n[**The Bay**](http://www.thebay.com/)\\n\\nCanadian Macy's, essentially. Carry all the main brands, Ralph Lauren, Levi's, Kenneth Cole, etc. Prices a bit high, but frequent sales. I quite like their Hudson Room brand.\\n\\n[**LL Bean**](http://www.llbean.com/) \\n\\nTalked about often on MFA, especially for their shoes. Free shipping, good quality for the price generally.\\n\\n[**Joe Fresh**](http://www.joefresh.com/en/) \\n\\nInexpensive basics. Available in Superstores and some independent JF stores (Vancouver has one I know). Good fit, simple designs, definitely worth having a look. I like their t-shirts a lot, better than H&M imo.\\n\\n[**RW&Co**](http://www.rw-co.com/) \\n\\nOnline and in-store. Classic, often semi-formal styles with more youthful cuts. Mid range pricing, worth it if you get things on sale. Their shirting and ties are quite nice.\\n\\n[**Nomad**](http://www.nomadshop.net/) \\n\\nBased in Toronto. Mainly nicer designer things (APC, Comme Des Garcon, Wings + Horns). Fairly expensive. Shipping is kinda pricey even in Canada, but if you can afford stuff here, an extra $15 probably won't break the bank.\\n\\n[**Haven**](http://havenshop.ca/) \\n\\nSimilar to Nomad, though they seem to carry a wider variety of brands, from  Arc'teryx Veilance and LVC to Converse and Adidas.\\n\\n[**Revolve Clothing**](http://www.revolveclothing.com/)\\n\\nA lot of designer things, wide selection in denim.

       " \"#Background: \\n\\nWith all the discussion recently about ALD and the pricing model, quality, and worth of the items they release, I thought there might be some interest in discussing the items I have bought, how much they cost, and how much I have enjoyed wearing them in my day to day life.\\n\\nI want to start this by giving an overview about me before I start, just to provide some context about myself and how I dress. I am a mid 20s dude living in a Midwest city who works in tech, so I can get away with a lot from a work clothing perspective, though I work in management so I aim for professional attire more often than not (very rarely wearing hoodies and the like). My work clothes and my street clothes tend to draw from the same pile, as post college didn’t have a lot of clothes and I hate the concept of having two separate wardrobes so to speak. I am still in the process of filling my closet, as I graduated within the last 3 years, but as of now it contains brands such as Todd Snyder, A Kind of Guise, Howlin, Gitman Bros, Brain Dead, Alden and Yuketen for shoes etc. and where applicable, I will make comparisons to these brands as I see fit. I will also say I believe the aim of Aime is one hype piece per drop, rather than filling your closet, like I’ve done here. Is this a recommendation to buy any of these clothes? No. Is this a bunch of money to spend on clothes? Yes. Do I care? Fuck no.\\n\\n#**Clothes:** \\n\\n#[Aime Leon Dore x Clark's Wallabees in Tan](https://www.woodwood.com/images/15515/clarks-x-ald-wallabee-beige-4.jpg) ($270)\\n\\nMy first Aime piece, a birthday gift to myself at the end of 2020. I am a huge Clarks fan, as I love the history (grew up around Jamaican immigrants when I was a kid in NY) and the versatility in my work and street fits. I have owned 2 wallabees before this: a Todd Snyder collaboration and a normal pair, and these are my favorite clarks by far. These are significantly more comfortable than both Clarks (especially the TS ones) and have a higher level of formality because of the casentino wool that I really appreciate. They really shine with gray sweatpants, but look at home with sweaters and chinos in the office. That being said, I do think the color of the maple suede clarks are a bit more versatile than these tan ones, so I reach for them far less often than I’d like. The casentino wool, while nice, is also a bit much to clean and because of this you can’t really wear them in the winter, which is when you’d like to wear wool shoes. \\n\\n**Worth it:** While I really like these I’d say save your money and buy a pair of maple suedes on sale, however if you really really like the casentino wool, I’d say cop, especially if you already own a more classic wallabee version. \\n\\n\\n#[Aime Leon Dore x Woolrich Shawl Cardigan](https://media.endclothing.com/media/f_auto,q_auto:eco/prodmedia/media/catalog/product/0/1/01-12-2020_MB_FW20KS012-JBC_1_1.jpg) ($267)\\n\\nSecond aime piece bought during the Queens sale. This baby is niiiiiiice, the quality is truly there. I have owned several cardigans and sweaters from Howlin, Uniqlo, and SNS Herring, and aside from SNS Herring the ALD cardigan blew the others out of the water. This cardigan is a really thick and soft 100% wool knit; I can often wear it over a cotton T-shirt in 30 degree weather and feel warm without irritation. Aside from the functionality, I love the colorful tree pattern and have yet to see anything even remotely similar. I frequently wear this in the office and in day to day activities. It is one of my most complimented pieces as well, and a year later I’m still smiling when I put it on. \\n\\n**Worth it:** YES, YES, YES! This is a piece I would try to save in a fire, and combined with getting it on sale I love the value, definitely worth it for me. \\n\\n#[Aime Leon Dore x Woolrich Braided Sweater](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fclothbase.com%2Fitems%2F8c0accc8_aime-leon-dore-woolrich-cable-knit-wool-sweater-orange&psig=AOvVaw1Hu2FuDHGSjXiNCKX3f-U2&ust=1650312396260000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAkQjRxqFwoTCOjM__Pym_cCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD) (173)\\nHot off the purchase of the shawl cardigan I went back and bought two of the fisherman sweaters as they looked quite thick and I wanted something for these intense midwest winters. Much like the shawl cardigan, I love these sweaters. Thick and warm, they are so comfortable and soft that I don’t mind spending all day in them. I also love the colors; I own the paprika and the parmesan, and I really like how modern the knit looks and how deeply colored the yarns are. These are sweaters I bust out more often than my Howlin sweaters, and they were around the same price point. Only downside is that pilling has started to develop under the arms, but based on the softness of the wool I’m not surprised so this is no big deal. \\n\\n**Worth it:** YES, YES, YES! These are great pieces, and combined with getting it on sale (again) I love the value, definitely worth it for me. \\n\\n\\n#[Aime Leon Dore x Drake’s Chore Coat](https://i.redd.it/i95ni2f8bbj81.png) (595)\\nI love Drake’s. Perhaps to an unhealthy amount for a normal person. So when I found the last ALD Ochre chore coat on Drake's website, I had to cop. This jacket is everything I’ve ever wanted and more. Perfectly cut so it doesn’t look oversized when placed over a T-shirt, but can fit a hoodie underneath. Longer than an average chore, so you can play with proportions with low rise or high rise trousers. Love the versatility; I wear it over an OCBD for interviews (it’s my lucky coat) and over t-shirts for something more casual. I love the details, the corduroy trim on the collar and sleeves, the five pockets, and the ALD/Drakes patch on the pocket. This is truly my favorite piece in my closet and one of my favorite garments I’ve ever handled. \\n\\n**Worth it:** I have an insurance policy on this jacket because if I were to lose it my world would be gray. This coat is a need at this point. Worth every penny.\\n\\n\\n#[Aime Leon Dore x Woolrich Quilted Workshirt](https://www.singularsilks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/flannels-shirt-jackets-aimc3a9-leon-dore-woolrich-quilted-overshirt-black-woolrich-mens.jpg) (595)\\n\\nWas really riding high on the ALD train when I bought this one. Would have also loved to be able to get the pants but alas it sold out. This one is definitely not worth it for the price I paid. That being said, it is my most worn jacket by far, it’s great for blocking wind, pretty warm, and  waterproof, in combination with a sweater from above I can wear at 10 degrees F and still be comfortable. It does “shed” some fibers from time to time, so I’m interested in how this piece will age in time. Not to mention, I really think any quilted jacket can achieve what this jacket does for my closet. However, I do like the general size as it’s a great midlayer, I love the buttoned vents at the back to increase airflow, I love that you can roll up the sleeves, and I like the collar. I will also add this in the jackets favor; I recently bought the Todd Snyder quilted jacket and pants, and I returned them immediately. The Woolrich jacket is significantly warmer and more durable, while the TS version is “softer” which makes me afraid of tearing. Was it worth the entire price difference? Not at all, but there is a quality difference worthy of mention. \\n\\n**Worth it:** Ehhhhh, most worn jacket but I think between all the other gorpcore options (Stone Island, Patagonia, Arcteryx, etc.) you can find something else at a more reasonable price point, though this jacket has grown on me. Pass on this one.\\n\\n\\n#[Aime Leon Dore x Drake’s Silk Scarf](https://www.heroification.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/drakes-scarves-mens-aimc3a9-leon-dore-for-drakes-dark-green-mughal-archer-print-tubular-silk-scarf-see-title.jpg) (395)\\n\\nLove this scarf, a very thick silk scarf. I have never had any other silk scarves, but the quality of the silk, the mughal print and color are all amazing. Love it as an accent accessory and it does keep my neck decently warm for above 20 degree temps. Makes my balmacaan fits look more “grown up” if you will. Definitely a high quality scarf, and oft complimented by others. Amazing!\\n\\n**Worth it:** Yep, I would recommend it if you love scarves, but if you’re not a huge accessories person it might not be for you. \\n\\n\\n#[Aime Leon Dore x Drake’s Striped Sweater](https://www.drakes.com/media/catalog/product/cache/82f85b849014499ea5e5f9865980b56c/k/n/kni-75woo-20960-001_lr.jpg) (138)\\nGreat sweater, grabbed it on sale from Mr. Porter, I love the midweight feel (significantly thinner than the Woolrich, more for 30s-40 F weather than 10s-20s) which is great for the fall and lighter winter days. Love the mock neck collar, and the brown and purple colored stripes are a fun combination. This is my usual fall dinner and drinks fit with some jeans and suede loafers. Looks very sophisticated in a way that doesn’t draw too much attention to you, which I enjoy. \\n\\n**Worth it:** Ehhhhh, would only say yes because I got it on sale, this is pretty much the same as my Howlin sweater, but I do prefer the mock neck and the color, so I end up wearing it way more often than the other midweight sweaters I own. \\n\\n\\n#[Aime Leon Dore x Drake’s Casentino Fleece](https://www.drakesarchive.com/media/catalog/product/cache/8ce37b85c5d2afd39087eb7ec5ea910d/d/r/dr2a5l-22279-01-500_lr.jpg) (995)\\nA controversial one! Oh boy were the ALDheads mad at this one! I bought and I fucking love it, tied in first place for my favorite garment piece after the Chore coat. I personally hate fleece, don’t love the material on my skin and really feel anxious about putting it in the wash. So a 100% wool pullover was right up my alley. This is what ALD/Drakes does really well imo, and it slaps as a garment. Love the quality of the pullover, not soft by any means, but not uncomfortable and incredibly hearty. I reach for it so often, especially in my wardrobe as a lot of it tends to skew more formal. Coffee with the SO? Movies with friends? Going to my local bookstore? Toss on the fleece, jeans and some Indy boots. Running to the grocery store? Fleece, sweats and sneakers. I also love wearing it on top of a button up or even another sweater for office wear. I can also fit a hoodie underneath which makes it great for more layered fits on colder days. Love the embroidery, and I love the structure of the collar. Wish I had grabbed the first iteration in purple as I feel it’s more versatile, but I still love the yellow, great 3 season piece. \\n\\n**Worth it:** Controversial to some but I’d say worth it. Love wearing it, it’s a piece I truly enjoy and put on quite often. \\n\\n\\n#[Aime Leon Dore x Drake’s Floral Hoodie ](https://images.stockx.com/images/Aime-Leon-Dore-Drakes-Floral-Hoodie-Blue.jpg?fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&w=700&h=500&fm=webp&auto=compress&q=90&dpr=2&trim=color&updated_at=1642118083)$200)\\nThis one I do like, better than my uniqlo and todd snyder hoodies but I got to say at the end of the day it is a hoodie. I like the pattern but this was clearly made in ALD factories as opposed to drakes, as the color doesn’t pop as much as the pictures. It’s a soft hoodie for sure, and again my most worn hoodie, but mostly for the pattern than anything else.\\n\\n**Worth it:** Love the hoodie, but it’s mid for the price.\\n\\n#Aime Leon Dore x Drake’s Big Apple Shirt ($95)\\nLike this shirt, but really the price I paid came down to the pattern on the back. I love a good white t-shirt in the summer months but this shirt is a thick one, so great for layering but I think it will be regulated to my spring and fall wardrobes. Compared to my Brain Dead T-shirts, I'd say the quality is the same, but the Brain Dead ones are cheaper (though not Made in Canada if that matters to you). Great quality but again this is just a t-shirt at the end of the day. \\n\\n**Worth it:** Love the t-shirt, but would recommend looking elsewhere for fun printed shirts \\n\\n\\n#Aime Leon Dore x Drake’s Tuxedo Jacket and Pants ($2390)\\nThe most expensive item in my closet, but fuck it I love this tuxedo jacket. I love the unstructured silhouette, the 6x2 double breasted buttons, the large lapels that add a really grand air when the jacket is open, but significantly more subdued when the jacket is closed. Love the midnight blue color. It really does look black in iridescent yellow lighting and the blue adds a certain level of panache when seen in the correct lighting. The patch pockets do make this jacket less formal, so I would not recommend wearing this in a setting in which the black tie details matter. However the patch pockets aren’t super noticeable unless someone is looking for it, and I think it does add some personality to the jacket. That being said, this is a fun jacket and  the pants are also well made. However the rise is quite high, not a complaint just something to note. \\n\\n**Worth it:** Absolutely not, on paper, would I recommend this Tuxedo set, but for me this is more of a collectors item than a wearable piece. I have longed to buy a formal suit set from Drake’s for a while, so decided to simply cop this one. \\n\\n\\n#[Aime Leon Dore x Woolrich Archive Shell Jacket](https://woolrich-cdn.thron.com/delivery/public/image/woolrich/0885fa3e-9b98-40c8-8617-aba44b1e70f7/zk128o/std/1600x2400/CFWOOU0520MRUT2820-2148.jpg) ($725)\\n\\nSo did a lot of research on this one and while I copped it, I would not recommend anyone else do the same. The colors are great, the best part of this jacket by far. After the woolrich drop this year, I looked high and low for something similar and couldn’t find something I liked that hit the same tone (aside from the Arc’teryx rush or the arc x beams collab). The jacket is only a 2L so it’s not going to last as long as a 3L jacket, nor be as waterproof,  and in terms of pure utility, you can definitely find a better jacket for a cheaper price. Now to be honest I’m not much of an outdoorsman, so I took the color over the functionality, but for my purposes it works. I have worn this jacket pretty much every day since I bought it two weeks ago and it holds up well in rain conditions. I walked for about 2 hours with it on and while my bottom half was soaking wet, my top half was completely dry. It is not a warm jacket, as it is only a shell, but it does a decent job of blocking the wind (even the hood) and I appreciate the armpit zips for increased breathability. I also like the microfiber detailing in the pocket and the neckline. The stashable hood also makes it very versatile. The hood itself works, but sadly is only 1 point adjustable, so it’s not the best fit for your head, but certainly not terrible as it will keep your face dry. \\n\\n**Worth it:** Absolutely not, buy something from Arc’teryx or Nike ACG if you can, the colors are super nice and I do like the details. This jacket, like the quilted work shirt, might hold up better than I expect, but if you are a more outdoorsy person, or want the best performance money can buy, look elsewhere. \\n\\n#Conclusion\\n\\nThis was a fun little exercise to go through. Made me realize that I don't need to buy every single Aime piece as it comes out. Don't get me wrong each and almost every piece is a piece that's a constant in my rotation. While, I love the designs and styling ALD puts out every season, there are just so many cool brands out there doing amazing things which will give you a little more bang for your buck.

Or do they not work that well together?\\n\\nAbout off-white and white in general, I know there are different shades and I would like to know if you have any to recommend? Would you rather recommend pure white, beige, ivory ? (bearing in mind that, as I said, I wear navy blue or black jeans most of the time). \\n\\nFinally, a little bonus question that I'll ask you, but do you consider the front pocket of the hoodies important? I'm asking because on a cool website I know, there is currently a quite interesting promotion, but its sweaters don't have front pockets, which makes me hesitate because I'm not used to it...\\n\\nThank you!\",\n",

I don't know if it was an exercise in bragging rights, fishing for someone to rob, or what, but it brought up an interesting point:\\n\\n*People, especially those people who might start frequenting MFA, spend a lot of money on clothing.*  \\n\\nOk, yeah.  We know that.  Often, it's a $40 shirt here, a $100 pair of sneakers there - substantial amounts sometimes, but nothing insane or bank-breaking.\\n\\nBut...\\n\\nThen a fire breaks out.  Or a flood.  Or you're robbed.  Does your homeowner/renters insurance policy (you DO have renters, right?) cover your collection of selvage denim and Alden boots?  I've had friends experience all three events (not at the same time), and each had drastically different experiences when it came to dealing with their insurance company and getting shit replaced. (Note that naturally this doesn't just apply to clothing - if you have a dSLR or nice computer setup, that stuff should be insured as well.)  \\n\\nIf my house burned down today, it would cost well over $15,000 to replace all of my clothing, from my underwear to my suits, piece for piece (who wants to replace all their wings+horns henleys with Old Navy?).  A lot of people have a similar amount of money tied up in their closet and don't even realize it.\\n\\nI used to keep all my receipts, pictures of my items, and details on everything in an Excel spreadsheet showing value, date of purchase, serial number, that kind of thing, but I recently saw an app called [Home Inventory](http://binaryformations.com/homeinventory/index.html) on Lifehacker and I've been meaning to try it out.\\n\\nBefore you do any of that though, check with your insurance agent.

       " 'The fez, named after the Moroccan city Fez, is a felt hat popularized during the Ottoman period. It has stood the test of time as a surefire sign of impeccable style and will undoubtedly continue to do so. Unfortunately, it is seldom mentioned what a remarkably versatile piece of headwear the fez truly is. Appropriate occasions can range anywhere from a formal black tie event, to a walk through the park, or even game day at your local sports bar. I created this guide to inspire utilization of the fez and hopefully help you find a fez that best suits your needs. \\n\\n[Here](https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7121/7030882785_6b9227a298_b.jpg) is an example of a formal fez. The black tassel is the perfect subtle complement to a black tie, or dark rimmed monocle. Gold tassels are slightly less formal and  generally reserved for pairings with navy or brown jackets. The key thing to look out for with a formal fez is the purity of the burgundy. There\\'s an old saying that goes \"A fez that\\'s not burgundy, is a fez that will burden thee.\" Abide by this or be prepared to get laughed out of a room with any serious fez enthusiasts. As far as price goes, you should be willing to spend $300-$800 for a handsome fez you can wear time and time again. \\n\\nVintage / throwback fez are super fun to wear out to parties! [Here](https://bid.auctionbymayo.com/images/lot/4098/4098022_0.jpg) is a prime example of such a fez you could paint the town burgundy in. Note the 1/4\" stem to tassel combo, the ornate jewel, and gorgeous lettering. Though the burgundy is slightly faded, it still makes for a nice fez somewhere between casual and upscale. Expect to pay $158-$273 for such a fez. \\n\\n[Here](https://www.kangaroomfg.com/assets/images/products/Products/FEZ-Maroon-1-website.jpg) is a more leisurely, sporty fez. The unpresumptuos half inch stem and breathable top make for a cool, casual summer look. I would not pay any less than $120 for such a fez or you will notice the [drop in burgundy quality](http://www.sillyjokes.co.uk/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/i/m/image_5409.jpg). That bold black trim nearly makes up for it though.\\n\\nI hope you found this guide helpful! Please let me know if you are aware of any high quality fez vendors online. I am a bit of a fez snob and generally eat the heavy shipping costs of having my fez hats expedited from Morocco but am willing to try some other milliners so long as the hat is guaranteed proper burgundy.\\n',\n",

I\\'m a big fan of William & Lockie\\'s shawl cardigan but LL Bean has a decent ragg wool option occasionally.   \\n  \\n######**Bottoms**  \\n  \\n**Chinos (2-3)**    \\nChinos are the workhorse of this part of the guide. There are a bunch of different stlyes of chinos out there, but a basic twill chino will give you the most flexibility (garment dyed chinos are great for casual wear but I find they don\\'t dress up well for the office)  \\n  \\n* Spier Mackay ($) (my suggestion is their contemporary fit high-rise version - more of a medium/high rise than a true high rise)  \\n* Brooks Brothers ($/$$) (BB is a great source for a several chino options - garment dyed and brushed twill are great casual options. The advantage chinos are my favorite for the office but not good for casual wear due to the permanent crease)   \\n* Jack Donnelly ($$$) (my favorite chinos thanks to their M3 fit\\'s high rise and gentle taper. Use code LL20 for 20% off)   \\n* Drake\\'s ($$$) (another great medium/high rise option but very expensive)   \\n  \\n**Denim (1-2)**    \\nDenim may not be \"Ivy\", but everyone should own at least one pair. Aim for something in a dark wash (or raw) with a medium to high rise and a straight/slim straight/straight tapered fit (depending on personal preference). A medium/light wash is a expansion piece. If you want to go down the denim rabbit hole, check out r/rawdenim.  \\n     \\n* Uniqlo ($)  \\n* Levi\\'s ($)  \\n* Spier Mackay ($) (can\\'t vouch for these personally)  \\n* Luxire ($$) (best way to get the exact fit you want though not the highest quality denim if that\\'s what you\\'re after)  \\n* OrSlow 105/107 ($$/$$$) (my personal favorite)   \\n* Drake\\'s ($$$) (great high rise that works well with casual tailoring)       \\n  \\n**Expansion items**  \\n1. Corduroy  \\nGreat cool weather option. I prefer a wider wale but that is a matter of personal preference. Brown gives you the most versatility, but olive and lighter browns/tans are great options too.   \\n  \\n* Spier Mackay ($$)   \\n* Brooks Brothers ($$)   \\n* Drake\\'s ($$$)   \\n  \\n2\\\\. Brushed twill chinos  \\nAnother great cool weather option. My only experience is with Brooks Brothers.  \\n\\n3\\\\. OG-107 fatigues  \\nCertainly not for everyone, but a fun alternative to chinos for casual wear.   \\n  \\n* Stan Ray ($$) - I like the tapered fit  \\n* OrSlow ($$$) (can\\'t vouch for these personally but they always get good reviews)  \\n  \\n4\\\\. Ecru Denim  \\nOn my purchase list, but not something I own personally.  \\n    \\n* Sid Mashburn ($$)  \\n* Drake\\'s ($$$)  \\n  \\n######**Tailoring**  \\n  \\n**Suits (1-2)**  \\nIf you don\\'t wear suits on a regular basis (which most people don\\'t) you can get by with just one suit in dark grey or navy. I prefer more contemporary suits so I won\\'t include the more traditional options like BB, O\\'Connell\\'s, J. Press, etc.  \\n  \\n* Spier Mackay ($$)   \\n* Drake\\'s ($$$$)  \\n  \\n**Sport coats (1-5)**     \\nWhether you need a sport coat and how many is entirely dependent on your office. If you wear them on a regular basis, a navy hopsack (brown horn buttons), grey herringbone, and a brown patterned jacket would be my suggested starting points. If you wear jackets often, you\\'ll probably want two warm weather grey/brown jackets and two cold weather grey/brown jackets. The world is your oyster when it comes to retailers and will be driven by preferred style and budget (ebay is a great way to build out a collection).  I prefer more contemporary jackets (with the exception of vintage BB and PRL), so I won\\'t include the more traditional options like BB, O\\'Connell\\'s, J. Press, etc.  \\n  \\n* Spier Mackay ($$) (the neo cut is nice but not exactly Ivy)   \\n* Juniors ($$$)   \\n* Sid Mashburn ($$$) (not my personal style preference but good a good option none the less)   \\n* Drake\\'s ($$$$)   \\n  \\n**Trousers (1-5)**     \\nWhat trousers you buy will be dictated by your office and climate. Basic worsted wool is the best starting point for 4-season wear, and wool flannel is the best starting point for cool weather wear. I\\'d suggest starting with a pair of medium grey and dark grey and expanding with navy and some shades of brown.  \\n   \\n* Land\\'s End ($$)  \\n* Spier Mackay ($$/$$$)   \\n* Drake\\'s ($$$$)  \\n   \\n######**Outerwear**    \\nPersonal preference and largely dictated by climate  \\n      \\n**Ivy Jackets (1-2)**    \\n1. Duffle coat (buy vintage gloverall on ebay)  \\n2\\\\. Barbour (buy vintage on ebay. My suggestion would be either beaufort or border to wear over a jacket)  \\n3\\\\. Top coat (I have one from uniqlo that get\\'s the job done)  \\n  \\n**Non-Ivy Jackets (1-2)**    \\n1. Blue chore coat\\nTons of options out there from vintage to new so I won\\'t go into details. The tend to be cut shorter so I would suggest shopping around for a slightly longer option.  \\n2\\\\. Jungle jacket \\nI think mil-surp can be folded in with Ivy style pretty easily and the Jungle Jacket is a great option  \\n        \\n* Vintage on ebay ($/$$)  \\n* Rothco ($)  \\n* OrSlow for ($$$)  \\n  \\n######**Shoes**  \\nYou could write a guide just on shoes, so I\\'m going to focus on maximum versatility.  \\n      \\n**Sneakers**    \\n  \\n* Chuck Taylors ($)  \\n* New Balance 574 ($$) or 99x series ($$$)  \\n  \\n**Mocs**  \\nCamp mocs are more versatile than ranger mocs and boat shoes imo.  \\n\\n* LL Bean ($$) (what I own because I like the additional structure/support over a true moccassin like Rancourt)  \\n* Rancourt ($$$)  \\n* Oak Street ($$$)  \\n  \\n**Loafers**  \\nA post could be written on loafers alone! Burgundy will give you the most flexibility. Beefrolls are a great casual option but don\\'t offer the versatility of half strap/pinch loafers.  \\n  \\n* Bass ($$) (the quality isn\\'t great these days but they get the job done.  \\n* Allen Edmonds ($$$)  \\n* Rancourt ($$$)  \\n* Grant Stone ($$$)  \\n* Alden LHS ($$$$)  \\n  \\n**Chukkas**    \\nGreat 4th option that can be dressed up and down  \\n      \\n* Clark\\'s ($)  \\n* Astorflex ($$) (personal favorite of mine)  \\n* Alden ($$$$) (another favorite)  \\n  \\n######**Accessories**  \\n   \\n**Ties (1-infinity)**    \\nTies are really a question of office environment. Most people won\\'t need more than 2 or 3. For maximum versatility, I\\'d suggest a solid navy grenadine, navy knit, striped (I like Navy and white though there are a ton of options from width, to color, and stripe pattern), and a couple patterned ties (preferably with a navy, burgundy, or green base). Ancient Madder is a great expansion option. There a dizzying number of retailers these days, so I just included my personal favorites.  \\n  \\n* Brooks Brothers ($)(probably not worth buying new as they are now imported, but a great ebay option)   \\n* Polo Ralph Lauren ($)(again, buy on ebay)   \\n* Chipp ($$)  \\n* Ascott ($$)  \\nKnit ties only - I think Kamakura\\'s made in Germany knit ties and Drake\\'s knit ties are ascot  \\n* Sam Hober ($$/$$$)  \\n  Great \"bespoke\" option at a relatively reasonable price point    \\n* Drake\\'s ($$/$$$)(again, buy on ebay or during sales)     \\n  \\n**Socks**   \\nI generally avoid novelty socks with limited exceptions. Solid colored socks are a great way to add some interest to any fit.  \\n  \\n* Uniqlo ($) (great solid colored socks and loafer socks)  \\n* American Trench ($$) (good retro socks but they are a bit short)   \\n* Viccel (can\\'t speak to them personally, but I\\'ve read good things about their over the calf socks)',\n",

Get \\'em in tan if you want something versatile and safe, red or orange if you want something bolder (but less versatile).  Stay away from black - it\\'s a terrible choice for casual footwear, especially in the summer.  The navy boat shoes are almost sold out, unfortunately, but there are most sizes still available in the other colors.  For something more sneaker-ey, [these Sperry-CVO-knockoffs](http://canvas.landsend.com/pp/StylePage-393321_X5.html?amp;CM_MERCH=REC-_-CVPP-_-GGT-_-2-_-393321-_-401124) are $21.97, available in tan and navy in a bunch of sizes, and will still qualify you for free shipping.  Put some rawhide leather laces in them to steal a look from the J.Crew summer catalog.  The boat shoes fit true-to-size and the sneakers fit 1/2 size big, according to the reviews on the website.  For all the LE stuff, you can return for free at any Sears store that carries LE (which is almost all of them).  Budget in $3 for some Gold Bond powder and wear them sockless.\\n\\n * [3 Lands\\' End polos](http://www.landsend.com/pp/mens-short-sleeve-original-pocket-mesh-polo-shirt~229210_59.html?bcc=y&action=order_more&sku_0=::HNB&CM_MERCH=IDX_overstocks-_-men-_-polos-t-shirts-turtlenecks&origin=index) - $9.97 each, free shipping if you order with the boat shoes above.  These aren\\'t the greatest polos in the world, but they\\'re available in a wide range of colors and sizes (including tall sizes).  Mainline Lands\\' End shirts are cut generously, so size down one.  For reference, I\\'m 6\\'2 and 185 lbs, and I wear a medium-tall comfortably.

From comments in a previous thread, they\\'re not great quality and run very long through the body.  They\\'re also a 60/40 cotton-poly blend.  Either way, whether it\\'s LE or ON, I recommend getting one in a dark color (charcoal or dark olive), one in the red/yellow family, and one in the blue/green family.  Figure out what colors would work best with the shorts you\\'re ordering below.  Don\\'t order a blue polo and blue shorts, for example, or red and red.

I\\'d get one pair in khaki and one pair in either blue or red (but see my note about colors above - make sure you\\'re buying a versatile kit where everything is interchangeable with everything else).  I wasn\\'t sure how these fit, so I live-chatted with Norma from LL Bean, Paula from Lands\\' End Canvas and Hector from J.Crew to get some measurements for comparison.  For a size 32 pair of 9\" inseam shorts, these LL Beans have a 34\" waist measurement and 23 3/8\" leg opening.

       " '**Caution**: The following paragraphs are confused ramblings from an old fart (34) who doesn\\'t know how fashion works anymore.\\n\\nI was an avid follower of MFA when I was in grad school in 2012-2014, which is how my current style got formed. This was the time when the hivemind was so unanimous about \"good outfits\" that the tongue-in-cheek [Basic Bastard](https://i.imgur.com/pirfcON.jpeg) uniform was created. Everybody else dressed like [lumberjacks that have developed a taste for slim fits](https://imgur.com/a/JU6V0).\\n\\nA lot of my opinions (and purchases) were informed by the discussions and WAYWT-threads and so I bought my pair of [Clark\\'s Desert Boots](https://imgur.com/a/rzH8xl6), [Levi\\'s 511 Rigid Dragons](https://imgur.com/r/malefashionadVice/3OE0Z), navy [Pea Coat](https://imgur.com/a/zpYPg) etc.\\n\\nAfter about two years I felt that I had developed a solid eye for style and so my interest for this sub waned. After all, you can only look at so many guys rocking Uniqlo OCBD shirts (slim fit, light blue) in the WAYWT-threads before it gets very repetitive.  But that was ok, the community saw themselves explicitly as a place for beginners to learn the essentials of dressing well, and users with more \"out there\" or artistic tastes sooner or later graduated to /r/malefashion or StyleForum.\\n\\nFrom 2014 to now I finished school, started a job, built a house, had a son, planted a tree... in short: Did a lot of other things with my life besides thinking about clothing.\\n\\nSomehow, a couple weeks back I remembered this sub and went back to have a look. After checking pretty much every WAYWT-thread since then I can confidently say: I have no idea how fashion works in 2022 anymore. I don\\'t mean that I dislike everything I see here, I literally mean I cannot judge if I like a fit or not at this point!\\n\\nTake the [most-upvoted fit from 2013](https://i.imgur.com/ddwuMa6.jpg) for example: I could confidently say that it\\'s a well put-together outfit because the colors match, the textures are interesting and most of all, the clothes *fit* just right: The shirt is slim but not tight, the seams are at the shoulders, the pants have the right length (with that neat little cuff that everybody was so into at that time) and so on.\\n\\nContrast that with a lot of the most-upvoted fits from recent WAYWT-threads (*apologies in advance, no offense intended*):\\n\\n* Like [this](https://i.imgur.com/3NKPjJ9.jpg) \\\\- How can we decide if items \"fit\" well when so many tops are baggy nowadays and pants all seem too short? Has the definition of fit completely changed... or is \"fit\" just not important anymore today? What makes this outfit good?\\n* Or [this one](https://imgur.com/a/3PffDyr). An upscale English tweed coat with a sweatsuit? Is that clash of levels of formality tongue-in-cheek or does the wearer not care? I see a lot of traditional coats this season with hoodies underneath. Is this considered appealing?\\n* Or [this one](https://imgur.com/a/kHEJdra) \\\\- What makes this a put-together outfit at all? To me it looks literally like a bunch of items thrown together completely randomly, I cannot see any concept behind that fit.. What am I missing?\\n\\nI hope no one feels offended or called out by this! I have to say I **love** that people are much more expressive in their style choices than they seemed to be in 2012-2014 and don\\'t take things too seriously.\\n\\nI am just really confused about what makes a \"good\" outfit nowadays.\\n\\n\\\\--\\n\\nEDIT: It looks like there are two camps in this sub: Those that want to learn the *skill* to dress well, just like many folks learn to cook good just good enough to feed themselves or to do some car maintenance for basic issues. Those were dominating in 2012-2014, when this forum was 90% self-help posts.\\n\\nAnd on the other hand there are those that treat fashion as a hobby, a form of *self expression*, a group that is much stronger today. And those two groups don\\'t neccessarily have good things to say to each other.\\n\\nThere is a lot of good discussion in this threat but some posts have a condescending tone about the other side (\"All modern fashion is baaaad and those 2022-kids look ridiculous\" vs \"Those 2012-folks looked boring and are out of touch!\").\\n\\n**I hope I made it very clear in my original post that I don\\'t want to complain about nowadays WAYWT-posts! I am genuinely baffled by the choices some people make for their outfits and hope to understand them better.**\\n\\nLove you all guys and no matter whether you\\'re a young whippersnapper or a mid-30s geezer like me: You do you!',\n",
       " \" A girl (who has a boyfriend) said this to me and it kind of stuck, namely because she is very hot, also because her friends all agreed and because I'm getting tired of the way I dress..\\n\\nAs for the way I currently dress.\\nOn nights out its;\\n- Vans Old Skools,\\n- Black Skinny jeans,\\n- plain t-shirt (black, white, beige, grey etc), maybe a sweater, or a shirt, or a shirt open over the t-shirt.

      "Gap and GQ have been running a collaboration featuring the \"best new menswear designers in America\" for a few years now. For 2015 that was Stampd, NSF, The Hill-Side, and David Hart. I caught the collection in stores when it first dropped, but passed initially (a little too expensive at first glance, a good amount of synthetic blends). However, less than a month after release they went on heavy discount - first online w/ a 40% discount code and then with an in-store price reduction + extra 60% off. About this time, u/micrafone_assassin posted a [great review](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/3p07sf/uniqlo_x_lemaire_and_gap_x_gq_the_hillside_david/) combined w/ Uniqlo x Lemaire impressions that got me to take a second look. I ended up picking up some of the items and thought it might be helpful to give my thoughts w/ some pics and fits, if for nothing else than for another data point to reference for those interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "**David Hart Wool Tweed and Windowpane Pants**\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a weakness for tweed. Throw in a white donegal-type flecked pattern and I don't stand much of a chance. The David Hart tweed for Gap + GQ is a twill weave blend composed of 62% wool, 28% nylon, and 10% silk (the % listed on tag slightly different than the website listed composition). The materials here are probably the biggest controversy - specifically the nylon content. A lot of guys have been conditioned over the years to reflexively recoil at the thought of synthetic fabrics. While there are good reasons for some of that, there are also some advantages to synthetic blends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nylon is a petroleum-based synthetic fiber used for many purposes, but in wool blends it adds resilience, is usually softer and less irritating (depending on the wool quality), and reduces matting and the shrinking tendencies of pure wool while being more wrinkle resistant. It's also cheaper. Those are all great things. The flip side of that is that nylon doesn't absorb moisture easily, so it can get trapped in a nylon-blended garment and feel a bit sticky against the skin as well as generally different in hand in a manner that some find off-putting. In addition, many people think of synthetics being used by garment makers with lower construction standards as one cost-cutting measure in a string of other cost-cutting measures, favoring a trend towards generally inferior products, especially where the percentage of synthetics is high. At the end of the day, though, it seems that the demonization of nylon and synthetic blends is, at the very least, a bit overboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wool tweed fabric is medium-heavy weight twill, with a slightly scratchy texture and a very subtle silky sheen if you look closely - it also feels a little different than wool/silk blend, I think because of the nylon - not necessarily bad. There's nothing particularly noteworthy about the construction, which is to say it's fine for the price point. The pants are flat front and lined to the knee in blue polyester.\n",
      "\n",
      "The windowpane pants are basically built identically, but with a 100% wool that I prefer in hand more as it's a little softer. In certain light, the blue windowpane pattern can be quite bright. It's a purely subjective matter, but that's my one potential hang up with this pair. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fit wise the pants fit fairly slim, but not aggressively so, coming from someone who wears 484 J Crew, some Fulton BR, etc. The waist is actually larger by about an inch than most vanity sizing at GAP, so I went down to a 30 from my normal 31 (actual waist size 33 where the pants sit). The leg opening is trim - fit pics are cuffed (currently at the tailor getting hemmed) to show a more ideal drape. The two pairs fit relatively the same, except that the pockets on the tweed tend to flare just a tiny bit, though I haven't noticed tightness anywhere in the hips or seat. Aside from that, I love the fit. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I look at value, I look at design, materials/construction, and fit vs. the street price of the item. For ~$35 and $40 on sale (YMMV depending on what discount is going on at the time, I don't think you can do that much better honestly. Clearly a high point of the collab.\n",
      "**TL:DR** - pants are great, value is exceptional on sale\n",
      "\n",
      "**David Hart Tweed Blazer**\n",
      "\n",
      "I have less glowing things to say about the blazer. It's the same material throughout, lined in the same polyester, but is exposed from a construction/materials standpoint in a manner that the pants aren't. In terms of specs, it's a 2 button notch lapel jacket with flap pockets and a center vent. On the inside there are a couple nice pockets for pens etc. The cuffs are functional, surprisingly, so if the length is more than off by a minor amount that could potentially be a problem. Obviously at this price point there's no canvassing or anything of the sort. Stitching is ok and there aren't any glaring deficits. However, it definitely doesn't have the same quality feel when in hand or wearing it that my other Suitsupply/Eidos Napoli/vintage jackets/etc have. That's not to say it feels awful, but there is a definite step down in quality on the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fit wise, it's short. These days short jackets have been the style, and that's fine, but if you're looking for closer to a conventional length, your ass is going to be left a bit uncovered. The size small fits my general 36R frame like a 36S. It's good through the body and chest, high arm holes, no pulling, not much collar gap at all, sleeves good length for me (slightly longer than a normal Suitsupply sleeve length, which I've always found to be a touch short). It feels okay and drapes alright considering it actually fits my frame pretty well, though wearing it I do notice a difference between my more expensive jackets. Some of that might be the initial wrinkles being worked out from the shipping process, but not sure about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a value standpoint, I paid ~$70 for the jacket, which is around what they're going for now. My tweed pants are at the tailor, so I can't judge the two together right now. What I'd say is this: it's okay if you're okay with a short length, some cost-cutting strategies that I do think effect the drape and fit slightly, and/or you're not willing to spend more for a higher quality, half or full canvassed jacket. You could certainly do a lot worse for the money, and it's not really fair to compare it to garments that cost 5-10x as much. That being said, it's important to understand it can't compete with those. For often <$200 as well you can get a J. Crew half canvassed Ludlow, which I would grade a notch above this from my standpoint in terms of build quality.\n",
      "**TL:DR** - for ~$70, it's decent, but falls a little short of a high value secondary to some noticeable drop off in construction vs. \"the gold standard\" half canvassing that you can get at a slightly higher price point\n",

      "\n",
      "This oxford feels for the most part similar in quality to other regular Gap items, though with a tab collar closure and back side pleats (small). It's a pretty starchy feeling cotton. The windowpane is made from a beautiful Pima cotton, and actually feels thinner and more refined in the hand. The focal point of the shirts is the tab collar closure, which is a cool feature you don't see often.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm 6' 155 lbs with a 15.5\" neck. Fit-wise, the shirts fit similar to a Bonobos slim S, a BR slim S, Uniqlo slim S, and very slightly more roomy than the J. Crew slim S for me. For me that's right on, with the sleeve length being a little shorter than J. Crew's (which I find to be too long for me). The tab collar is cool, but know that you have to have a skinny tie to close it behind the knot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the oxford shirt for $18 and the windowpane online at $30 - the windowpane is the nicer of the two. For average to slightly above average quality compared to the mainstream market, a little cool design thrown in with the tab collar, and a great fit these shirts are a good value on sale.\n",

It's 55%/45% lambswool/nylon, which is a lot of nylon, though it feels pretty good in person. Made in the Cowichan style, it features a more earthy-toned geometric pattern, shawl collar, zip closure, with two welt pockets and ribbed hem and cuffs. Out of all the pieces, I think this one has the most character.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sized down to an XS based on some reviews online, which fit alright in the shoulders but was too tight for my 6', 155 lb frame when zipped up through the sleeves and body (unzipped looked fine). I can't say too much more about the fit as I didn't get the right size, aside from it being too small for me, unfortunately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discounted to $139 and selling at ~$80's depending on the discount, it's at the upper limit of what I would pay for it given the fabric constraints, but one of my favorite pieces in the bunch in regards to design - I'm just hoping I can a size that fits me better. You can find a lot of cheaper sweaters around, but this one is a real life piece and, I think, one of the strongest in the collection bar none.\n",

      "The Hill-Side excels at workwear oriented design featuring usually heavy textiles and fall/winter fabrics. These herringbone pants are a great example of that, and are built from a 67% cotton, 20% polyester, 13% acrylic fabric that feels entirely like cotton to me in the hand. It's a nice weave with front stitched panels above the knee down - easy to miss, but a nice detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waist on the Hill-Side pants is pretty consistent with the rest of Gap sizing (I took a 31 waist - my normal for gap), and fits like a slim straight through the rest of the garment. It's fuller than the David Hart pants with a larger leg opening as well, which I think suits the aesthetic. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Hill-Side pants in store went as low as $26 for me, and varies online depending on the sale code. It was a surprise favorite for me, and something I originally passed on until I took a second look.\n",

It, in my opinion, should have enough room to layer and yet shouldn't look too baggy. The Small size did that for me. \n",

The fabric is thinner but not \"silky\" like alot of summer weight khakis, it's a thin twill. \n",

Decided to take fit shots with all of these on at once to minimize the number of pics I took. Not sure I’d actually wear this combo. Had a rough hair day too so bear with me….\n",

      "\n",
      "**Fabric:** The blazer and pants are wool/cashmere 90/10%.  The wool blend fabric is thick, comfortable, and not itchy in the slightest.  It’s soft and warm, and the pants feel like the comfiest sweatpants you’ve ever worn.  My only gripe with the fabric is the color of the olive… it’s a dark, grey ish olive that is devoid of depth.  I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing (maybe to some) but I just wish it was a bit more like the olive wool from Filson which has a bit more vibrant of a dark olive with some brown notes mixed in. That’s just wishful thinking though.\n",
      "\n",
      "The turtleneck is 100% cashmere. I don’t really have too much experience with 100% cashmere besides an old scarf I have, but the turtleneck is thin (compared to the olive wool blend) yet still has a good weight to the overall garment.  Obviously soft and warm as hell. The color is black, and it’s a good black. Tactlelneck here I come.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fit:** The jacket is a size medium and fits pretty true to size, if anything a bit smaller than TTS.  The jacket fits me a bit more snug than other blazers I’ve owned/returned, and I’m still kind of up in the air on how it fits. It feels great when it isn’t buttoned, but once it is it feels a bit tight at the chest and armpit region. I think the arm holes are really high and if your shirt under the blazer isn’t too (like a sweater or something) it’ll bunch up and make it feel off.  Then again, it is a thick ish wool fabric with many interior/exterior pockets which most certainly take up some space.  So I’m going to give this one the benefit of the doubt that it’ll break in a bit to fit better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pants fit me very well IMO.  The upper block fits well without use of the cinches, and with them tightened it gives the pants a snug and comfortable fit without the constriction of a belt.  These definitely have a slim feel to them while still being slightly relaxed in the thighs/knees.  Love the fit of these pants, strongly considering buying another pair in black during the restock in the winter.\n",

Also a chest pocket.  Inside was a bit of a surprise… there are 4 total pockets: one button closure and one zipper closure on each side.  The inside is lined with a canvas/nylon in the body and a poly in the sleeves, which has finished seams at the arm holes.  There is also canvas/nylon detail under the collar, (not pictured) plus a snap button to for the neck closure.\n",

I was very up in the air on this one and more or less picked them up to try out and see in person what The Hillside was putting out with a big brand like Gap.  I have a few things from The Hillside and I think they’re OK so I figured why not.  I went into this purchase 90% certain I was going to return at least one if not both of these items….\n",

The blazer’s fabric is soft and hairy while having a good weight/stiffness to it. The pants are the same way, just a bit lighter in color.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Fit:** The blazer fits true to size and has a great taper through the body while still having some room for layers.  The pants I’d say are slim but more of a slim straight fit.  I did a medium for the blazer and a 34x34 for the pants (which seemed to fit small in length and in waist vs the tweed 34x32’s I immediately returned because they were huge in the waist and length).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Design:** Blazer is a great casual design with the two patch pockets at the hands and a chest patch pocket.  2 buttons, an average sized notched lapel, and the removable neck closure gives it a nice optional detail. I think it works well with the collar down but I’m not sure how I like it just yet with the collar up.  Also two pockets on the interior, a back vent, finished arm seams, sleeve lining, and functional cuffs.  Pretty surprised with this from Gap, it’s on par (maybe minus an amazing overall design that something like a Bedford has) with jackets 2-3x the price that I’ve handled.  This blazer would be a great first casual blazer for someone to pick up.  \n",

      "Description: [Album](http://imgur.com/a/xxJot)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background**\n",
      "\n",
      "Gap and GQ have been running a collaboration featuring the \"best new menswear designers in America\" for a few years now. For 2015 that was Stampd, NSF, The Hill-Side, and David Hart. I caught the collection in stores when it first dropped, but passed initially (a little too expensive at first glance, a good amount of synthetic blends). However, less than a month after release they went on heavy discount - first online w/ a 40% discount code and then with an in-store price reduction + extra 60% off. About this time, u/micrafone_assassin posted a [great review](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/3p07sf/uniqlo_x_lemaire_and_gap_x_gq_the_hillside_david/) combined w/ Uniqlo x Lemaire impressions that got me to take a second look. I ended up picking up some of the items and thought it might be helpful to give my thoughts w/ some pics and fits, if for nothing else than for another data point to reference for those interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "**David Hart Wool Tweed and Windowpane Pants**\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a weakness for tweed. Throw in a white donegal-type flecked pattern and I don't stand much of a chance. The David Hart tweed for Gap + GQ is a twill weave blend composed of 62% wool, 28% nylon, and 10% silk (the % listed on tag slightly different than the website listed composition). The materials here are probably the biggest controversy - specifically the nylon content. A lot of guys have been conditioned over the years to reflexively recoil at the thought of synthetic fabrics. While there are good reasons for some of that, there are also some advantages to synthetic blends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nylon is a petroleum-based synthetic fiber used for many purposes, but in wool blends it adds resilience, is usually softer and less irritating (depending on the wool quality), and reduces matting and the shrinking tendencies of pure wool while being more wrinkle resistant. It's also cheaper. Those are all great things. The flip side of that is that nylon doesn't absorb moisture easily, so it can get trapped in a nylon-blended garment and feel a bit sticky against the skin as well as generally different in hand in a manner that some find off-putting. In addition, many people think of synthetics being used by garment makers with lower construction standards as one cost-cutting measure in a string of other cost-cutting measures, favoring a trend towards generally inferior products, especially where the percentage of synthetics is high. At the end of the day, though, it seems that the demonization of nylon and synthetic blends is, at the very least, a bit overboard.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wool tweed fabric is medium-heavy weight twill, with a slightly scratchy texture and a very subtle silky sheen if you look closely - it also feels a little different than wool/silk blend, I think because of the nylon - not necessarily bad. There's nothing particularly noteworthy about the construction, which is to say it's fine for the price point. The pants are flat front and lined to the knee in blue polyester.\n",
      "\n",
      "The windowpane pants are basically built identically, but with a 100% wool that I prefer in hand more as it's a little softer. In certain light, the blue windowpane pattern can be quite bright. It's a purely subjective matter, but that's my one potential hang up with this pair. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fit wise the pants fit fairly slim, but not aggressively so, coming from someone who wears 484 J Crew, some Fulton BR, etc. The waist is actually larger by about an inch than most vanity sizing at GAP, so I went down to a 30 from my normal 31 (actual waist size 33 where the pants sit). The leg opening is trim - fit pics are cuffed (currently at the tailor getting hemmed) to show a more ideal drape. The two pairs fit relatively the same, except that the pockets on the tweed tend to flare just a tiny bit, though I haven't noticed tightness anywhere in the hips or seat. Aside from that, I love the fit. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I look at value, I look at design, materials/construction, and fit vs. the street price of the item. For ~$35 and $40 on sale (YMMV depending on what discount is going on at the time, I don't think you can do that much better honestly. Clearly a high point of the collab.\n",
      "**TL:DR** - pants are great, value is exceptional on sale\n",
      "\n",
      "**David Hart Tweed Blazer**\n",
      "\n",
      "I have less glowing things to say about the blazer. It's the same material throughout, lined in the same polyester, but is exposed from a construction/materials standpoint in a manner that the pants aren't. In terms of specs, it's a 2 button notch lapel jacket with flap pockets and a center vent. On the inside there are a couple nice pockets for pens etc. The cuffs are functional, surprisingly, so if the length is more than off by a minor amount that could potentially be a problem. Obviously at this price point there's no canvassing or anything of the sort. Stitching is ok and there aren't any glaring deficits. However, it definitely doesn't have the same quality feel when in hand or wearing it that my other Suitsupply/Eidos Napoli/vintage jackets/etc have. That's not to say it feels awful, but there is a definite step down in quality on the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fit wise, it's short. These days short jackets have been the style, and that's fine, but if you're looking for closer to a conventional length, your ass is going to be left a bit uncovered. The size small fits my general 36R frame like a 36S. It's good through the body and chest, high arm holes, no pulling, not much collar gap at all, sleeves good length for me (slightly longer than a normal Suitsupply sleeve length, which I've always found to be a touch short). It feels okay and drapes alright considering it actually fits my frame pretty well, though wearing it I do notice a difference between my more expensive jackets. Some of that might be the initial wrinkles being worked out from the shipping process, but not sure about that.\n",
      "\n",
      "From a value standpoint, I paid ~$70 for the jacket, which is around what they're going for now. My tweed pants are at the tailor, so I can't judge the two together right now. What I'd say is this: it's okay if you're okay with a short length, some cost-cutting strategies that I do think effect the drape and fit slightly, and/or you're not willing to spend more for a higher quality, half or full canvassed jacket. You could certainly do a lot worse for the money, and it's not really fair to compare it to garments that cost 5-10x as much. That being said, it's important to understand it can't compete with those. For often <$200 as well you can get a J. Crew half canvassed Ludlow, which I would grade a notch above this from my standpoint in terms of build quality.\n",
      "**TL:DR** - for ~$70, it's decent, but falls a little short of a high value secondary to some noticeable drop off in construction vs. \"the gold standard\" half canvassing that you can get at a slightly higher price point\n",
      "\n",
      "**David Hart Oxford and Windowpane shirt**\n",
      "\n",
      "This oxford feels for the most part similar in quality to other regular Gap items, though with a tab collar closure and back side pleats (small). It's a pretty starchy feeling cotton. The windowpane is made from a beautiful Pima cotton, and actually feels thinner and more refined in the hand. The focal point of the shirts is the tab collar closure, which is a cool feature you don't see often.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm 6' 155 lbs with a 15.5\" neck. Fit-wise, the shirts fit similar to a Bonobos slim S, a BR slim S, Uniqlo slim S, and very slightly more roomy than the J. Crew slim S for me. For me that's right on, with the sleeve length being a little shorter than J. Crew's (which I find to be too long for me). The tab collar is cool, but know that you have to have a skinny tie to close it behind the knot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got the oxford shirt for $18 and the windowpane online at $30 - the windowpane is the nicer of the two. For average to slightly above average quality compared to the mainstream market, a little cool design thrown in with the tab collar, and a great fit these shirts are a good value on sale.\n",
      "**TL:DR** - The pink oxford with an interesting tab collar closure and the more luxurious windowpane Pima cotton shirt are both a good value on discount if they fit into your wardrobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "**David Hart Wool Zip Sweater**\n",
      "\n",
      "This sweater is a beast. It's heavy, thick as hell, and weighs a ton. I'm not sure I can even remember seeing a sweater quite this substantial in quite some time. It's 55%/45% lambswool/nylon, which is a lot of nylon, though it feels pretty good in person. Made in the Cowichan style, it features a more earthy-toned geometric pattern, shawl collar, zip closure, with two welt pockets and ribbed hem and cuffs. Out of all the pieces, I think this one has the most character.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sized down to an XS based on some reviews online, which fit alright in the shoulders but was too tight for my 6', 155 lb frame when zipped up through the sleeves and body (unzipped looked fine). I can't say too much more about the fit as I didn't get the right size, aside from it being too small for me, unfortunately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Discounted to $139 and selling at ~$80's depending on the discount, it's at the upper limit of what I would pay for it given the fabric constraints, but one of my favorite pieces in the bunch in regards to design - I'm just hoping I can a size that fits me better. You can find a lot of cheaper sweaters around, but this one is a real life piece and, I think, one of the strongest in the collection bar none.\n",
      "**TL:DR** - beast of a sweater, great design but bulky, if you can deal with that\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Hill-Side Herringbone Pants**\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hill-Side excels at workwear oriented design featuring usually heavy textiles and fall/winter fabrics. These herringbone pants are a great example of that, and are built from a 67% cotton, 20% polyester, 13% acrylic fabric that feels entirely like cotton to me in the hand. It's a nice weave with front stitched panels above the knee down - easy to miss, but a nice detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waist on the Hill-Side pants is pretty consistent with the rest of Gap sizing (I took a 31 waist - my normal for gap), and fits like a slim straight through the rest of the garment. It's fuller than the David Hart pants with a larger leg opening as well, which I think suits the aesthetic. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Hill-Side pants in store went as low as $26 for me, and varies online depending on the sale code. It was a surprise favorite for me, and something I originally passed on until I took a second look.\n",
      "**TL:DR** - Glad I went to take a second look at these. Great buy if you like the style.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Impressions**\n",
      "\n",
      "Collaborations tend to be hit-or-miss for me, and this one is no exception. There are pieces that I really like and think are great values (the pants, in general), things that design-wise really speak to me (the sweater), and a lot of items that leave me unimpressed. I'm hoping the early sales aren't an indication that the collection fell flat on its face this year, though, as I always look forward to seeing the collab lineup every year.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are still a lot of sizes available for many items, and I'd recommend taking a look if you feel like some of them speak to you.

      "I was excited for this from the day it was released. I’ve been looking forward for a fairly priced olive blazer/pants combo in a FW fabric and once I heard about this I made the commitment to pick it up.  The black turtleneck was just something extra I thought would be cool to tack on.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Fabric:** The blazer and pants are wool/cashmere 90/10%.  The wool blend fabric is thick, comfortable, and not itchy in the slightest.  It’s soft and warm, and the pants feel like the comfiest sweatpants you’ve ever worn.  My only gripe with the fabric is the color of the olive… it’s a dark, grey ish olive that is devoid of depth.  I don’t think it’s necessarily a bad thing (maybe to some) but I just wish it was a bit more like the olive wool from Filson which has a bit more vibrant of a dark olive with some brown notes mixed in. That’s just wishful thinking though.\n",
      "\n",
      "The turtleneck is 100% cashmere. I don’t really have too much experience with 100% cashmere besides an old scarf I have, but the turtleneck is thin (compared to the olive wool blend) yet still has a good weight to the overall garment.  Obviously soft and warm as hell. The color is black, and it’s a good black. Tactlelneck here I come.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fit:** The jacket is a size medium and fits pretty true to size, if anything a bit smaller than TTS.  The jacket fits me a bit more snug than other blazers I’ve owned/returned, and I’m still kind of up in the air on how it fits. It feels great when it isn’t buttoned, but once it is it feels a bit tight at the chest and armpit region. I think the arm holes are really high and if your shirt under the blazer isn’t too (like a sweater or something) it’ll bunch up and make it feel off.  Then again, it is a thick ish wool fabric with many interior/exterior pockets which most certainly take up some space.  So I’m going to give this one the benefit of the doubt that it’ll break in a bit to fit better.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pants fit me very well IMO.  The upper block fits well without use of the cinches, and with them tightened it gives the pants a snug and comfortable fit without the constriction of a belt.  These definitely have a slim feel to them while still being slightly relaxed in the thighs/knees.  Love the fit of these pants, strongly considering buying another pair in black during the restock in the winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tactleneck fits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Design:** The jacket and the pants shine here.  The jacket has two functional flap pockets (with little extra button closures) and a ticket pocket above the right flap pocket. Also a chest pocket.  Inside was a bit of a surprise… there are 4 total pockets: one button closure and one zipper closure on each side.  The inside is lined with a canvas/nylon in the body and a poly in the sleeves, which has finished seams at the arm holes.

I was very up in the air on this one and more or less picked them up to try out and see in person what The Hillside was putting out with a big brand like Gap.  I have a few things from The Hillside and I think they’re OK so I figured why not.  I went into this purchase 90% certain I was going to return at least one if not both of these items….\n",

      "\n",
      "…. And there is zero way I’m returning either.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Fabric:** I was apprehensive of the fabric blends they used (blazer = cotton/acrylic/poly – 55/30/15%; pants = cotton/poly/acrylic – 68/22/18%) but they are unique while not too over the top to be versatile.  The blazer’s fabric is soft and hairy while having a good weight/stiffness to it. The pants are the same way, just a bit lighter in color.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Fit:** The blazer fits true to size and has a great taper through the body while still having some room for layers.  The pants I’d say are slim but more of a slim straight fit.  I did a medium for the blazer and a 34x34 for the pants (which seemed to fit small in length and in waist vs the tweed 34x32’s I immediately returned because they were huge in the waist and length).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Design:** Blazer is a great casual design with the two patch pockets at the hands and a chest patch pocket.  2 buttons, an average sized notched lapel, and the removable neck closure gives it a nice optional detail. I think it works well with the collar down but I’m not sure how I like it just yet with the collar up.  Also two pockets on the interior, a back vent, finished arm seams, sleeve lining, and functional cuffs.  Pretty surprised with this from Gap, it’s on par (maybe minus an amazing overall design that something like a Bedford has) with jackets 2-3x the price that I’ve handled.  This blazer would be a great first casual blazer for someone to pick up.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The work pants are pretty basic besides the extra fabric below the knee and the coin pocket at the front right.  Button fly with meh quality plastic buttons, cool blue herringbone pocket bags and lined waistband, tucked and tacked belt loops, back welt pockets… nothing thrilling here in terms of details but the fabric and fit IMO is better than I expected. These were very comfortable to wear.\n",
      "\n",
      "**TL;DR:** Didn’t expect much from either of these, surprised most with how good the fabrics are despite the contents.  Fit, color/fabric, design of blazer is very versatile.

      "**Fabric:** The best part of these garments are hands down the fabric… brown tweed wool/nylon/silk 60/30/10% that is substantial in weight and an incredibly smooth, almost silky feeling to the touch.  For me, the biggest issue is pairing this with footwear that will compliment it.  That’ll be the only reason I return it… if I can’t make it work with my current footwear.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fit:** The jacket fits slightly differently than the Hillside blazer but is essentially the same fit.  The only difference is the body and sleeves feel a bit more trim.  Other than that, it’s the same.  Go TTS. I got a size medium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pants - TBD\n",
      "\n",
      "**Design:** Definitely a bit more formal than the Hillside blazer due to flap pockets at the side and a chest welt pocket.  The shoulders are structured, body and sleeves are fully lined with a navy blue poly, the cuffs are functional, a single vent at the back, one right interior pocket and 4 left interior pockets (2 of which are pen pockets), and an average sized and notched lapel.  The pen pockets are wicked fun IMO and for me will be fantastic at work so I don’t have to put pens in the chest pocket, and can look extra cool taking a pen out of the inside of my jacket.  \n",

      "\n",
      "**TL;DR:** Brown, tweed, wool, silk, more formal, slim fit, #fall.\n",

      "**Overall:** I think the bottom line here is that if these articles fit you, if they’re in a fabric you like that works with clothes you have, then the value of each article is great to fantastic.  150 for a jacket like either of the Gap ones is really an amazing deal/value.  If you’re considering anything that I picked up here in this initial impressions, I suggest you order it for yourself and see what you think. You’ll most likely be very pleased pending the fit.\n",

They are the right length and I even got one inch bigger than my typical waist size to compensate but they're just annoyingly tight on my thighs. Im a 175 pound 21 year old, 6 feet tall, I guess my thighs are a little big from playing sports and biking but this is a new problem for me, are there some jeans that just won't work for certain people? Often when I sit down my butt crack shows and it's hard to lift my legs up to get on my bike for example. They would be my favorite pair of jeans if they weren't so difficult. I might post pictures later, I'm at work now.\n",

      "The collection offers a great opportunity to try out more designer oriented and unique items at much lower prices than you could otherwise pay. My first pair of raw denim was $32 instead of the starting point of say Unbranded at ~$90. I was able to get a unique and perfectly fitting chambray with a tilted pocket for the same price as an Old Navy shirt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything is holding up fine even though they are the items I wear most often. The \"quality\" may not be on par with the main lines on everything but it offers a ton of pieces that are either great quality to cost ratio or very unique. Those are the only items that really matter, and every year there are at least a dozen pieces like this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some people talk about this kind of High Fashion Fast Fashion collabs as if they were diffusion lines. But at least for the Gap collections it is being designed by the designers of the main lines (unlike say Polo Sport which Mr. Ralph Lauren probably doesn't even know exists).\n",

I know, I know, not uniform. I own and love Levi's but i'm 5'4\" with short legs and Gap makes size 28  length. My initial thought with these pants is that I blew straight through size 32 waist and now need something closer to a 31 or maybe even a 30. I'm afraid that right now they make my pelvis and thighs look lumpy. Do they look that bad or am I being nit-picky? and how is the length? The first two pictures are the selvidge wash and the last is the dark indigo wash which is more of a canvas type material.\n",

They are just a bit snug in the middle width-wise, but with the stretching that will occur with leather, I believe they will be perfect with a few wears. The problem is that when they are laced (straight lacing), the gap between the eyelet tabs (I don't know the term) is greater than 1 inch. While they feel fine on my feet, I've never seen a picture where the gap was this large, and while it would almost always be covered by the bottom of my pants, it doesn't seem right. I have a relatively high instep, which is most likely the cause of the problem.\n",

      "Has anyone noticed that banana republic has gone downhill in terms of creativity these last 5 years or so? Their previous pieces of clothing were pretty good and I usually bought a few items every year. However, I've noticed that most jackets now have too many pockets and the creativity of everything on the site is pretty lackluster. Did they fire their creative talents or something? thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "First I'd like to say thank you to all of the very knowledgeable people on here who helped my tremendously with choosing new suits. Prior, I had a number of older suits of varying quality and fit that I had accumulated over many years. These were all donated to make way for a refresh. I was looking for a 40 short suit, slim fit, standard 6\" drop. I'm 5'9\", 175lbs, muscular build across the shoulders and in the legs and a few extra pounds in the belly. My biggest issue when buying clothes is finding a good fit in the upper legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "After extensive reading on Reddit and elsewhere, I narrowed it down to the following (in descending order of cost):\n",
      "\n",
      "- Brooks Brothers Milano\n",
      "- Suit Supply Lazio or Havana\n",
      "- J.Crew Ludlow slim fit\n",
      "- Banana Republic slim fit Italian wool\n",
      "\n",
      "I ended up not even trying Suit Supply as I had already found stuff I liked but as for the others:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Ordering and Customer Service**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Brooks Brothers: I shopped in store but was disappointed to discover that they didn't have *any* Milano cut suits in stock. I was able to look at fabrics and tried on a Regent fit suit. The pants actually fit reasonably well and could have been tailored to a nice fit but the jacket hung like a sack. The sales person was quite knowledgeable but really tried to make the sale on a Regent whereas I went ahead with ordering Milano online (1x Milano Plaid 1818 and 1x Milano stretch-wool 2 button 1818)\n",
      "- J.Crew: They only had 1 slim-fit style/color in stock (Navy) but the sales person was great and assured me that the quality control was good and that any of the suits in the lineup will fit exactly the same. I ordered 3x Ludlow slim-fit, one in each color (light blue, charcoal, navy)\n",
      "- Banana Republic: Good selection in store but no sales help. It was all sold as separates and it was a bit difficult to find the right sizes. In the end I went home and ordered 1x slim italian wool and 1x houndstooth wool.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Quality**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Brooks Brothers: To my untrained eye, the fabric and construction was a head and shoulders above the others. I was very impressed with the overall quality and couldn't find any faults.\n",
      "- J.Crew: The wool felt very nice and I checked everything over carefully for construction faults. Couldn't really find anything though. My one complaint was that the suit I liked the best (harbor blue) has an ugly white striped lining. Overall though I was very happy.\n",
      "- Banana Republic: Two very different results with the 2 suits. The houndstooth was terrible (navy, no longer on the website). The fabric looked worn and was kind of fuzzy and the lining was a butterfly style for warm weather. I probably didn't read the description well enough but it definitely looked a lot worse than the website pics. The italian wool one was much nicer though. It was obviously lower quality than the other ones but still looked great and actually fit the best of all pre-tailoring. I liked the peak lapels and the overall look of the suit a lot. One annoyance was that they sewed a cleaning instructions label into the lining seam where it is very visible. I tried to remove it but didn't want to damage anything so it will be a job for the tailor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fit**\n",
      "\n",
      "- All of the jackets fit rather nicely with a little bit of tailoring needed for the arms length only.\n",
      "- For the pants though, the Milano cut was *far* to slim in the thighs. I think it would be more comparable to the extra-slim from the other lines. The waist too was a lot tighter despite being the same size. It wouldn't have been a problem to let out a little (salesperson said +1.5\" max) besides the cost and hassle of extra tailoring.\n",
      "- Pants for the ludlow and BR fit great right out of the box with just some minor tailoring for length needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Price**\n",
      "\n",
      "- I was pretty happy with the prices I got from all three companies. I already had a Gap credit card for BR and I got ones for BB and JC as well for the extra discount. After Christmas is a good time to buy suits!\n",
      "- Brooks Brothers: Original price was 1x $1,198 and 1x 998 but sale was 2 for $1,190. After the new credit card discount, the total was $1,004 including 6.25% tax, so **$502** each. Not worth the full price though as the quality jump wasn't as big as the price jump.\n",
      "- J.Crew: Original price was $650 but I got a 1 day cardholders sale of -25% so **$496.50** each including tax. Great price but barely less than BB. Probably worth it at full price if you needed something quickly but otherwise a great deal at the sale price.\n",
      "- Banana Republic: Full price was $568 but I got a great deal here at **$300** each (no tax for some reason). I think additional sales can go as low as $250. At these prices they are well worth it but definitely not at full price. These suits are perfect budget options if you need to wear one everyday and can save the nicer suits for more important events (which is my plan).\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end I kept all three J.Crew Ludlows and the Banana Republic Italian wool. I hope this helps someone else going through the same process. Good luck!\n",

      "Hey everyone, I used to buy tailored slim fit dress shirts from Banana Republic (and the 3 options as I recall were regular, slim, and tailored slim).  I just went to their site after about 6 months and see that the options are now \"Camden Standard Fit\" and \"Grant Slim Fit\" without any explanation of the change.  I called Banana Republic to see if Grant Slim Fit was the equivalent of Tailored Slim Fit, or just a regular slim fit, and the product customer rep said that she did not have that kind of information.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does anyone here happen to know if the Grant is essentially the new Tailored Slim Fit or has BR just done away with that fit of dress shirt?  I appreciate any information anyone might have on the subject.\n",
      "Banana Republic seems to be getting more and more popular as of lately and I can partially see why. I personally love their Chino's which, while a bit more pricey, present a great value for the price, as do ALOT of items that Banana Republic sells. \n",

      "The thing though is this - I've never seen Banana Republic, whether in store or online, without a 40% off sale going on in some form or fashion. The sale is never the ENTIRE store, but it is a good portion and the \"40% off\" sign is always on the front door/online front page. What does it say about a brand to ALWAYS have such an extensive discount on their products? That they're overpriced without the sale? That they have a crap ton of different product lines that they're always introducing and getting rid of? That their sale prices are just their regular prices and the sale is just to get people in the door? \n",

I wiped my tears and bought a new pair (that’s three pants purchases for those counting at home). \n",
      "\n",
      "Another few months went by, and I once again noticed a huge hole in my crotch. This seemed odd because the blue denim colored pants had no such problems. So I went back to the Banana Republic and purchased yet another pair. I had lost 27 pounds over the course of this time, and now found it was time to move into the size 34x34, and purchased those (purchase number four!) \n",
      "\n",
      "A few months went by and [another](http://imgur.com/gallery/BP2tB) huge [hole in the crotch.](http://imgur.com/gallery/MNiZu) Still no problems with the blue denim. I took them back to the store and asked if they would exchange them, which they did (Banana Republic has fantastic customer service from my experience). Another pair of the charcoal 34x34’s and away I went. \n",
      "\n",
      "You guessed it. Less than two months now and last weekend the hole in the crotch showed up again! I’m at a point where I am pretty bummed because I love these pants, but I can’t continue to spend $128.50 a pop for them, and I’m not interested in being the guy who keeps going back in for an exchange. \n",
      "\n",
      "If I were you, I would think, “well, fatass, you probably have the wrong size and you’re just wearing these poor pants out.” While I agree that I still have some weight to lose, I think the following [pictures](http://imgur.com/gallery/Y4dFN) show that I am definitely not [“pouring”](http://imgur.com/gallery/fpY4o) myself into these jeans. The fit is good, with some comfortable breathing room in the waist area. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, consider this a public service announcement. Take it from the guy who has now spent nearly $550 this year on these fucking pants, they are not worth it. Yes, they look and feel great.

      "But unlike say, Brioni or Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Gieves and Hawkes' off the rack lineup isn't just \"bespoke but made to a standard template\", it went down market.

      "\n",
      "Gieves and Hawkes has a very traditional cut, but a very good looking one. They are after all, the most well known example of the Saville Row style, where the suit is trim, but not tight. Where the emphasized figure is big chest and broad shoulders, not the hourglass shape. It is a timeless cut, and IMO, it is far better than the Brooks Brothers sack (another commonly mentioned example of a timeless cut).\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's the thing: Gieves & Hawkes has adopted the J Crew model of retail: most of their lineup is on sale at any given moment. On sale, their suits start at ~£300, and their jackets are start at ~£200. At these prices, they're shooting straight at the J Crew/Hugo Boss price tier. \n",

      "- Brooks Brothers: I shopped in store but was disappointed to discover that they didn't have *any* Milano cut suits in stock. I was able to look at fabrics and tried on a Regent fit suit. The pants actually fit reasonably well and could have been tailored to a nice fit but the jacket hung like a sack. The sales person was quite knowledgeable but really tried to make the sale on a Regent whereas I went ahead with ordering Milano online (1x Milano Plaid 1818 and 1x Milano stretch-wool 2 button 1818)\n",
      "- J.Crew: They only had 1 slim-fit style/color in stock (Navy) but the sales person was great and assured me that the quality control was good and that any of the suits in the lineup will fit exactly the same. I ordered 3x Ludlow slim-fit, one in each color (light blue, charcoal, navy)\n",
      "- Banana Republic: Good selection in store but no sales help. It was all sold as separates and it was a bit difficult to find the right sizes. In the end I went home and ordered 1x slim italian wool and 1x houndstooth wool.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Quality**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Brooks Brothers: To my untrained eye, the fabric and construction was a head and shoulders above the others. I was very impressed with the overall quality and couldn't find any faults.\n",
      "- J.Crew: The wool felt very nice and I checked everything over carefully for construction faults. Couldn't really find anything though. My one complaint was that the suit I liked the best (harbor blue) has an ugly white striped lining. Overall though I was very happy.\n",
      "- Banana Republic: Two very different results with the 2 suits. The houndstooth was terrible (navy, no longer on the website). The fabric looked worn and was kind of fuzzy and the lining was a butterfly style for warm weather. I probably didn't read the description well enough but it definitely looked a lot worse than the website pics. The italian wool one was much nicer though. It was obviously lower quality than the other ones but still looked great and actually fit the best of all pre-tailoring. I liked the peak lapels and the overall look of the suit a lot. One annoyance was that they sewed a cleaning instructions label into the lining seam where it is very visible. I tried to remove it but didn't want to damage anything so it will be a job for the tailor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fit**\n",
      "\n",
      "- All of the jackets fit rather nicely with a little bit of tailoring needed for the arms length only.\n",
      "- For the pants though, the Milano cut was *far* to slim in the thighs. I think it would be more comparable to the extra-slim from the other lines. The waist too was a lot tighter despite being the same size. It wouldn't have been a problem to let out a little (salesperson said +1.5\" max) besides the cost and hassle of extra tailoring.\n",
      "- Pants for the ludlow and BR fit great right out of the box with just some minor tailoring for length needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Price**\n",
      "\n",
      "- I was pretty happy with the prices I got from all three companies. I already had a Gap credit card for BR and I got ones for BB and JC as well for the extra discount. After Christmas is a good time to buy suits!\n",
      "- Brooks Brothers: Original price was 1x $1,198 and 1x 998 but sale was 2 for $1,190. After the new credit card discount, the total was $1,004 including 6.25% tax, so **$502** each. Not worth the full price though as the quality jump wasn't as big as the price jump.\n",
      "- J.Crew: Original price was $650 but I got a 1 day cardholders sale of -25% so **$496.50** each including tax. Great price but barely less than BB. Probably worth it at full price if you needed something quickly but otherwise a great deal at the sale price.\n",
      "- Banana Republic: Full price was $568 but I got a great deal here at **$300** each (no tax for some reason). I think additional sales can go as low as $250. At these prices they are well worth it but definitely not at full price. These suits are perfect budget options if you need to wear one everyday and can save the nicer suits for more important events (which is my plan).\n",

The sale is never the ENTIRE store, but it is a good portion and the \"40% off\" sign is always on the front door/online front page. What does it say about a brand to ALWAYS have such an extensive discount on their products? That they're overpriced without the sale? That they have a crap ton of different product lines that they're always introducing and getting rid of? That their sale prices are just their regular prices and the sale is just to get people in the door? \n",

I wiped my tears and bought a new pair (that’s three pants purchases for those counting at home). \n",
      "\n",
      "Another few months went by, and I once again noticed a huge hole in my crotch. This seemed odd because the blue denim colored pants had no such problems. So I went back to the Banana Republic and purchased yet another pair. I had lost 27 pounds over the course of this time, and now found it was time to move into the size 34x34, and purchased those (purchase number four!) \n",
      "\n",
      "A few months went by and [another](http://imgur.com/gallery/BP2tB) huge [hole in the crotch.](http://imgur.com/gallery/MNiZu) Still no problems with the blue denim. I took them back to the store and asked if they would exchange them, which they did (Banana Republic has fantastic customer service from my experience). Another pair of the charcoal 34x34’s and away I went. \n",
      "\n",
      "You guessed it. Less than two months now and last weekend the hole in the crotch showed up again! I’m at a point where I am pretty bummed because I love these pants, but I can’t continue to spend $128.50 a pop for them, and I’m not interested in being the guy who keeps going back in for an exchange. \n",
      "\n",
      "If I were you, I would think, “well, fatass, you probably have the wrong size and you’re just wearing these poor pants out.” While I agree that I still have some weight to lose, I think the following [pictures](http://imgur.com/gallery/Y4dFN) show that I am definitely not [“pouring”](http://imgur.com/gallery/fpY4o) myself into these jeans.

      "Description: It's interesting how, in your mind there are some brands that you'd never think you'd be able to afford. And then one day, you finally decide to go check them out, perhaps to splurge on a Grail piece, only to find out that they've pushed themselves down-market to compete with pedestrian brands. It's like saving up your whole life to buy a Ferrari, and then one day, you finally walk into the dealership, only to find that they sell Honda Civic competitors for $20,000 now. \n",
      "\n",
      "That pretty much sums up what I think of Gieves & Hawkes. At one point, they were thought of as the greatest brand in menswear, making suits that cost more than a months salary for royalty. After all, they are 1 Saville Row. But then, eventually, they (like every other classic menswear brand) dipped their tows into off the rack. \n",
      "\n",
      "But unlike say, Brioni or Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Gieves and Hawkes' off the rack lineup isn't just \"bespoke but made to a standard template\", it went down market. If their bespoke stuff is fantastic and worthy of royalty, their off the rack stuff is mass market and nothing really special. \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the pieces of theirs that my brother has, Gieves and Hawkes RTW has mediocre construction, you know, \"it's fine\". Based on the construction, their suits and structured jackets are mediocre, the same stuff that you'll find at say, Hugo Boss or J Crew. \n",
      "\n",
      "But their real strength is the materials. They sell overcoats of pure alpaca, wool linen silk blends in their light sports jackets, some of their suits also use wool from top mills like Loro Piana. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gieves and Hawkes has a very traditional cut, but a very good looking one. They are after all, the most well known example of the Saville Row style, where the suit is trim, but not tight. Where the emphasized figure is big chest and broad shoulders, not the hourglass shape. It is a timeless cut, and IMO, it is far better than the Brooks Brothers sack (another commonly mentioned example of a timeless cut).\n",
      "\n",
      "But here's the thing: Gieves & Hawkes has adopted the J Crew model of retail: most of their lineup is on sale at any given moment. On sale, their suits start at ~£300, and their jackets are start at ~£200. At these prices, they're shooting straight at the J Crew/Hugo Boss price tier. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gieves and Hawkes is sitting at J Crew tier prices. But I think their house cut is better than J Crew's \"skinny lapel, trim fit\" suits. They also are willing to use more interesting materials than J Crew. I guess they're also still more prestigious than J Crew or Banana Republic (but I have to say, their brand value is dropping fast)\n",
      "\n",
      "At the end of the day, Gieves and Hawkes RTW uses great materials for the most part, has a fantastic house cut, and construction that is in line with what you expect from their price range.
